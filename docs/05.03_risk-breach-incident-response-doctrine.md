05.03 — Risk, Breach & Incident Response Doctrine
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative doctrine for identifying, managing, escalating, responding to, and closing risks, breaches, and incidents affecting the marketplace.

Incidents are treated as governance events with mandatory auditability, not as ad-hoc operational issues.

2. Scope

This doctrine applies to all incident types, including:

• Regulatory breaches
• Legal or contractual violations
• Financial loss or misallocation
• Security events (data, access, integrity)
• System outages or degradation
• Third-party failures
• Compliance revocations
• Pricing or settlement anomalies

No domain is exempt.

3. Definitions

Risk: A potential event that may cause harm if realised.
Incident: A realised event causing or threatening harm.
Breach: An incident involving violation of law, regulation, contract, or governance rule.

All breaches are incidents; not all incidents are breaches.

4. Incident Classification

Incidents must be classified at creation as one of:

• Informational
• Minor
• Major
• Critical

Classification is based on impact, not perception.

5. Severity Determination

Severity is assessed using:

• Regulatory exposure
• Financial exposure
• Data integrity impact
• Operational disruption
• Reputational impact

Critical incidents require immediate escalation.

6. Incident Detection Sources

Incidents may be detected via:

• Automated monitoring and alerts
• Audit findings
• Supplier or buyer reports
• Internal reviews
• Third-party notifications
• Regulator communications

Detection time must be recorded.

7. Mandatory Incident Record

Every incident must generate an incident record containing:

• Incident ID
• Classification and severity
• Description and timeline
• Affected systems and data
• Root cause analysis
• Immediate containment actions
• Linked risks and controls
• Escalation path taken
• Resolution actions
• Closure approval

Incomplete records are invalid.

8. Containment & Mitigation

Upon identification:

• Containment actions must be executed immediately
• Further damage must be prevented
• Evidence must be preserved
• Temporary system blocks may be enforced

Containment precedes remediation.

9. Escalation Rules

Incidents must be escalated when they involve:

• Regulatory obligations
• Financial loss
• Personal or sensitive data
• Payment integrity
• System-wide impact

Escalation timelines are mandatory and enforceable.

10. Breach Handling

Breaches require:

• Legal assessment
• Regulatory notification analysis
• Executive awareness
• Formal response plan

No breach may be handled informally.

11. Regulator Notification

Where required by law or regulation:

• Notification thresholds must be evaluated
• Notifications must be time-bound
• Evidence must be preserved
• Disclosure must be accurate and complete

Failure to notify is itself a breach.

12. Evidence Preservation

All incident evidence must be:

• Preserved immutably
• Timestamped
• Access-controlled
• Linked to incident and risk records

Evidence handling follows forensic standards.

13. Communication Controls

Incident communications must be:

• Role-appropriate
• Logged and auditable
• Consistent with legal advice

Public or supplier communications require approval.

14. Post-Incident Review

Every major or critical incident requires:

• Root cause analysis
• Control effectiveness review
• Risk register updates
• Governance artefact updates

Lessons learned must be documented.

15. Closure Criteria

An incident may only be closed when:

• All remediation actions are complete
• Residual risks are assessed
• Approvals are recorded
• Evidence is archived

Closure must be formally approved.

16. Change Control

Changes arising from incidents must follow:

• Formal change control
• Risk reassessment
• Versioned documentation updates

Emergency changes remain auditable.

17. Audit & Reporting

Incident data must support:

• Regulator inspection
• Internal audits
• Trend analysis
• Control improvement planning

Historical reconstruction must be possible.

18. Enforcement Rules

• No incident without a record
• No closure without approval
• No deletion of incident records
• No bypass of escalation rules

Violations block system progression.
