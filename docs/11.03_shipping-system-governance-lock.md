11.03 — Shipping System Governance Lock
1. Purpose

This document formally locks the shipping system architecture, behaviours, and enforcement rules for the marketplace.

Shipping is treated as a regulated operational system, not an auxiliary service. Once locked, shipping behaviour may not be altered without formal change control.

2. Governing Principle

No shipment may occur outside governed, auditable, and deterministic system paths.

Shipping must never:

• Bypass compliance
• Bypass duty or tax calculation
• Bypass pricing snapshots
• Operate without audit traceability

3. Scope

This governance lock applies to:

• Shipping workflows
• Carrier integration rules
• Shipping state transitions
• Data flow between shipping, payments, and compliance
• Failure handling

Out of scope:

• Commercial freight pricing rules (Phase 6)
• Payment execution (Phase 12)

4. Authoritative Shipping Model

The shipping system is authoritative for:

• Shipment creation
• Shipment status tracking
• Delivery confirmation
• Shipment failure signalling

External carrier systems are informational only.

5. Shipping Preconditions

A shipment may be created only if:

• Product compliance is verified
• HS classification is validated
• Duties and GST are deterministically calculated
• Pricing snapshot is locked
• Order state is approved for fulfilment

Failure of any precondition blocks shipment creation.

6. Shipping States (Immutable)

The following shipment states are permitted:

• Pending
• Packed
• Dispatched
• In Transit
• Delivered
• Delivery Failed
• Cancelled

States may only progress forward, except for governed failure paths.

7. State Transition Governance

State transitions:

• Must be system-triggered
• Must be logged immutably
• Must include timestamp and actor

Manual state overrides are prohibited.

8. Carrier Integration Rules

Carrier integrations must:

• Operate asynchronously
• Use timeout-enforced calls
• Never block core workflows

Carrier responses cannot override system truth.

9. Timeout & Reliability Enforcement

All carrier API calls must:

• Enforce strict timeouts
• Fail closed
• Log failures as operational events

Hanging or retry-loop behaviour is prohibited.

10. Shipping Data Integrity

Shipping data must:

• Be immutable once recorded
• Reference the originating order
• Reference HS and duty records

Partial or orphaned records are prohibited.

11. Delivery Confirmation Governance

Delivery confirmation:

• Is required for escrow release
• Must be recorded immutably
• Cannot be spoofed by suppliers

Carrier confirmation is advisory, not authoritative.

12. Failure & Exception Handling

Shipping failures must:

• Trigger CRM cases
• Pause escrow release
• Notify affected parties
• Preserve all evidence

Silent failures are prohibited.

13. Interaction with Other Extensions

Shipping interacts with:

• Payments (escrow release)
• Compliance (delivery conditions)
• CRM (exceptions and disputes)
• Reporting (audit and regulator exports)

No extension may override shipping state.

14. Change Control Lock

Changes to the shipping system require:

• Formal change request
• Risk assessment
• Version increment
• Governance approval

Hotfixes without documentation are prohibited.

15. Audit & Regulator Readiness

The system must support:

• Shipment lifecycle replay
• Carrier interaction logs
• Failure reconstruction
• Time-based audits

16. Enforcement Doctrine

On shipping governance breach:

• Shipment is halted
• Funds remain escrowed
• Incident is logged
• Escalation rules apply
