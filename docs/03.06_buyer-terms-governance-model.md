03.06 — Buyer Terms Governance Model
1. Purpose

This document defines the legal, contractual, and system-enforced governance framework governing buyers who transact through the marketplace.

Its objectives are to:

• Establish enforceable buyer terms
• Align buyer rights with governed system behaviour
• Prevent ambiguity in buyer expectations
• Ensure disputes, refunds, and remedies are contractually anchored
• Produce regulator- and court-defensible buyer records

Buyers do not merely “use” the platform.
They enter into a governed contractual relationship.

2. Governing Principles

Buyer participation is governed by the following principles:

• No buyer transaction without accepted terms
• No implied consent — acceptance must be explicit
• No checkout without contractual binding
• System truth overrides marketing or UI representations
• Buyer rights are enforced through governed workflows

3. Scope of Buyer Terms

This governance applies to:

• Individual consumers
• Commercial buyers
• Bulk and negotiated-order buyers
• Any entity placing orders through the platform

Different buyer classes may have additional schedules, but all inherit the base terms.

4. Mandatory Buyer Agreements

At minimum, buyers must accept:

Marketplace Buyer Terms & Conditions

Privacy & Data Handling Notice

Dispute Resolution & Refund Policy

Compliance Acknowledgement (regulated goods)

Acceptance is mandatory prior to account activation or checkout.

5. Acceptance & Binding Mechanism

Buyer terms are accepted through a governed system process:

• Clear presentation of current version
• Explicit affirmative acceptance (no pre-checked consent)
• Timestamped acceptance record
• Version identifier recorded
• Hash stored with buyer profile

No transaction may occur without a recorded acceptance.

6. Contract–System Binding

Once accepted, buyer terms govern:

• Eligibility to place orders
• Refund and return rights
• Dispute escalation pathways
• Evidence requirements
• Limitation of liability boundaries
• Jurisdiction and governing law

The platform enforces these terms automatically.

7. Buyer Obligations

Buyers are contractually required to:

• Provide accurate identity and delivery information
• Use the platform in good faith
• Comply with regulated-goods requirements
• Accept governed dispute outcomes
• Refrain from circumvention or misuse

8. Buyer Rights

Buyers are entitled to:

• Transparent pricing at commitment
• Access to compliance documentation
• Order tracking and status visibility
• Governed dispute and refund processes
• Evidence-backed decision outcomes

Rights exist only within governed workflows.

9. Disputes & Remedies

Disputes are governed by:

• Defined dispute windows
• Evidence submission rules
• Escalation thresholds
• Platform-mediated resolution
• Binding outcomes per terms

Buyers cannot bypass platform dispute mechanisms.

10. Prohibited Buyer Actions

Buyers may not:

• Circumvent checkout or pricing mechanisms
• Pressure suppliers outside the platform
• Manipulate refunds or disputes
• Misuse compliance documents
• Abuse support or escalation paths

Such actions may result in account suspension.

11. Regulatory & Compliance Alignment

Buyer terms explicitly acknowledge:

• Sale of regulated goods
• Compliance requirements
• Jurisdiction-specific obligations
• Limitations imposed by law

12. Change Control

Buyer terms may only change through:

• Legal review and approval
• Versioned updates
• Mandatory re-acceptance where required
• Audit-logged deployment
