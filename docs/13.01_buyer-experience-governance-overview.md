13.01 — Buyer Experience & Order Lifecycle Governance Overview
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance boundaries, constraints, and principles that apply to the buyer-facing experience and the full order lifecycle.

Its purpose is to ensure that buyer UX is a faithful projection of governed system truth, not an independent or optimistic interface layer.

2. Governing Principle

Buyer experience reflects reality.
Governance defines reality.

At no point may buyer-facing UI override, mask, or reinterpret backend governance outcomes.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Marketplace browsing
• Product visibility
• Checkout flows
• Order confirmation
• Order tracking
• Document access
• Communications
• Buyer-initiated actions

Out of scope:

• Marketing content not tied to transactions
• External analytics tools

4. Buyer Role Definition

A Buyer is a governed system role with:

• Authenticated identity
• Jurisdictional context
• Transaction history
• Rights bounded by compliance state

Buyers do not possess system override authority.

5. Visibility Rules

Buyers may only see:

• Products that are fully compliant
• Prices derived from live pricing logic
• Availability that reflects actual fulfilment capability

Hidden states must remain hidden.

6. Product Information Integrity

Displayed product information must:

• Match approved catalogue records
• Reference verified compliance documents
• Reflect accurate certifications and limits

No “preview,” “draft,” or speculative data is permitted.

7. Pricing Presentation Rules

Buyer-facing pricing must:

• Be derived directly from pricing engines
• Reflect margin floor enforcement
• Display incentives transparently

UI formatting does not affect price truth.

8. Checkout Governance

Checkout is governed by:

• Pricing snapshot generation
• Compliance verification
• Freight and tax calculation
• Payment eligibility rules

Checkout cannot proceed without a valid snapshot.

9. Order Commitment Moment

An order is committed when:

• Buyer confirms checkout
• Pricing snapshot is locked
• Payment intent is created

After commitment, pricing is immutable.

10. Order Status Lifecycle

Order states must be:

• Explicit
• Sequential
• Non-skippable

Typical states include:

• Created
• Paid
• In fulfilment
• In transit
• Delivered
• Completed
• Exception / Dispute

State changes are audit-logged.

11. Buyer Order Tracking

Buyers may track:

• Order state
• Shipment status
• Compliance milestones

Tracking reflects backend state only.

12. Document Access Governance

Buyers may access:

• Invoices
• Compliance certificates
• Shipping documents

Documents are immutable and versioned.

13. Buyer Communications

All buyer communications must:

• Be system-generated or system-authorised
• Reference order IDs and snapshot IDs
• Be logged immutably

No off-platform commitments are binding.

14. Buyer-Initiated Actions

Buyers may initiate:

• Returns
• Refund requests
• Support cases

Actions are subject to governance validation.

15. Error & Exception Handling

When exceptions occur:

• Buyers are informed factually
• No speculative resolution timelines are shown
• Escalation is governed

UI must not promise outcomes.

16. Accessibility & Fairness

Buyer experience must:

• Be accessible
• Be non-discriminatory
• Apply rules consistently

Governance applies equally.

17. Audit & Evidence

All buyer actions generate:

• Event logs
• State transitions
• Evidence records

Buyer experience is auditable.

18. Change Control

Any change to buyer experience that affects:

• Pricing display
• Order lifecycle
• Buyer rights

Requires formal change approval.

19. Enforcement Status

This governance is:

• Mandatory
• Runtime-enforced
• Non-bypassable

UI exceptions are prohibited.
