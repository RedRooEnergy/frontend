10.03 — Product Submission & Validation Workflow
1. Purpose

This document defines the governed, non-bypassable workflow for supplier product submission, validation, approval, rejection, and lifecycle control. It ensures that no product can enter, change, or remain in the catalogue without satisfying category, attribute, compliance, pricing, and governance constraints.

Product submission is treated as a controlled regulatory event, not a form submission.

2. Governance Doctrine

Products are admitted into the system only by satisfying all upstream governance artefacts.

The workflow must ensure:

• Structural correctness before visibility
• Compliance before commerce
• Auditability before convenience
• Immutability once approved

No role may bypass validation stages.

3. Scope

This document governs:

• Supplier product creation
• Validation sequencing
• Approval and rejection states
• Product modification rules
• Withdrawal and suspension handling

Out of scope:

• Category schema definition (10.02)
• Pricing and promotions (Phase 6)
• Freight execution (Phase 11)

4. Entry Preconditions

A supplier may submit a product only if:

• Supplier status is Approved
• Supplier compliance is valid and active
• At least one Active category exists
• Required attribute templates are available

Failure of any precondition blocks submission initiation.

5. Product Draft Creation

Upon initiation:

• Product is created in Draft state
• Category selection is mandatory
• Category version is locked immediately
• Attribute template is auto-attached

Draft products are invisible to buyers and administrators except via governance views.

6. Attribute Population Rules

Suppliers must:

• Populate all mandatory attributes
• Respect data types and constraints
• Use enumerated values where defined

Validation is continuous and blocking.

Free-form overrides are prohibited.

7. Document Attachment Requirements

Before submission, suppliers must attach:

• Product-level compliance documents
• Category-mandated certifications
• Jurisdiction-specific evidence

Document requirements are auto-derived from category and compliance governance.

8. Pre-Submission Validation Gate

Before submission:

• Attribute completeness is verified
• Schema conformity is enforced
• Compliance document presence is validated
• Pricing snapshot pre-check is performed

Any failure blocks progression.

9. Submission State

Once submitted:

• Product state becomes Pending Review
• Product becomes immutable to supplier edits
• A full audit snapshot is created

No modifications are allowed during review.

10. Review & Approval Workflow

Approval requires:

• Automated validation pass
• Human or rule-based governance review (if configured)
• Compliance verification confirmation

Outcomes:

• Approved → Product becomes Active
• Rejected → Product returns to Draft with reasons
• Suspended → Product frozen pending resolution

11. Activation Rules

Upon approval:

• Product becomes Active
• Product is indexed into catalogue generation
• Pricing snapshot is locked
• Compliance references are bound

Activation is atomic.

12. Modification & Versioning Rules

Post-approval changes:

• Require new product version creation
• Must re-pass validation gates
• Cannot alter historical records

Original product versions remain immutable.

13. Withdrawal & Deactivation

Products may be:

• Withdrawn by supplier (pre-sale only)
• Suspended by governance (any time)
• Retired due to category retirement

Withdrawals preserve audit history.

14. Failure & Exception Handling

Failures include:

• Validation failures
• Compliance expiration
• Category deprecation

System responses are deterministic and logged.

15. Audit & Evidence Capture

Each workflow stage records:

• Actor and role
• Timestamp
• Input and output states
• Governing artefact references

All records are immutable and exportable.

16. Extension Interaction Rules

Other extensions may:

• Read product state
• Validate against product status

They may not:

• Modify submission state
• Override validation logic
• Activate products

17. Non-Functional Guarantees

This workflow guarantees:

• Zero unvalidated products
• No silent schema drift
• Complete traceability
• Regulator-safe operation
