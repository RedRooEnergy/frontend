10.01 — Product & Catalogue Governance (Overview)
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance framework, scope, and non-negotiable rules for the Product & Catalogue Governance Extension. It establishes how products are defined, validated, controlled, published, and withdrawn under Immutable Core enforcement.

Products are regulated system artefacts, not free-form listings.

2. Governance Doctrine

No governed category. No compliant attributes. No valid product. No visibility.

The platform must ensure that:

• Every product conforms to a locked category schema
• Mandatory attributes and documents are enforced
• Compliance is validated before visibility
• Publication is explicit and auditable
• Catalogue state reflects system truth only

There is no “draft visibility,” “soft publish,” or “fix later” path.

3. Scope

This extension governs:

• Product definition and lifecycle
• Category and attribute enforcement
• Product-level compliance attachment
• Catalogue inclusion and exclusion
• Visibility and publication control

Out of scope:

• Supplier onboarding (Phase 9)
• Pricing and promotions (Phase 6 & 12)
• Buyer checkout (Phase 13)

4. Relationship to the Immutable Core

This extension:

• Depends on Core identity, RBAC, audit logging, and governance hooks
• Cannot mutate Core data models
• Cannot bypass compliance, authorization, or change control

All actions are validated by 08.05 Governance Enforcement Hooks.

5. Product Definition

A Product is a governed entity that represents a specific, sellable item with:

• A single supplier owner
• A fixed category assignment
• A governed attribute set
• Mandatory compliance documentation
• A defined lifecycle state

Products are not marketing constructs. They are compliance-bearing records.

6. Catalogue Definition

The Catalogue is a governed aggregation of eligible products that:

• Have passed validation
• Are approved for visibility
• Meet current compliance and supplier state

Catalogue inclusion is dynamic and revocable.

7. Product Lifecycle States (High-Level)

Canonical states:

• Draft
• Submitted
• Under Review
• Approved
• Published
• Suspended
• Withdrawn

State transitions are explicit, audited, and governed.

8. Supplier Preconditions

A supplier may submit products only if:

• Supplier state = Approved
• Identity verification = Valid
• Mandatory certifications = Valid
• No active restrictions exist

Failure of any condition blocks submission.

9. Category Governance (Preview)

Each product must:

• Belong to exactly one locked category
• Use that category’s approved attribute template
• Satisfy mandatory attributes

Categories are defined in Phase 10.02 and cannot be overridden per product.

10. Attribute Enforcement (Preview)

Attributes:

• Are strongly typed
• May be mandatory or optional
• May have validation constraints
• Are category-specific

Free-text attributes for regulated fields are prohibited.

11. Compliance Attachment (Preview)

Products must attach:

• Product-level certifications
• Test reports where required
• Jurisdiction-specific evidence

Compliance attachment rules are enforced prior to approval.

12. Visibility Doctrine

Product visibility requires:

• Product state = Published
• Supplier state = Approved
• Compliance state = Valid

Visibility is withdrawn automatically if any condition degrades.

13. Audit & Evidence

Every product action must log:

• Actor identity
• Supplier context
• Product identifier
• Action taken
• Previous and resulting state
• Timestamp

Audit records are immutable and regulator-exportable.

14. Extension Interaction Rules

Downstream extensions may:

• Query product and catalogue state
• Subscribe to publication events

They may not:

• Modify product governance state
• Bypass approval or compliance checks

15. Non-Functional Guarantees

Product & catalogue governance prioritises:

• Correctness over speed
• Enforcement over flexibility
• Auditability over convenience
