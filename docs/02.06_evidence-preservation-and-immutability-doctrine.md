02.06 — Evidence Preservation & Immutability Doctrine
1. Purpose

This doctrine defines the mandatory rules for evidence creation, preservation, immutability, and integrity assurance across all documents, records, logs, and artefacts produced by the platform.

Its objective is to ensure that all evidence produced by the system is:

• Tamper-resistant
• Legally defensible
• Audit-ready
• Regulator-safe
• Forensically sound

Evidence under this doctrine must remain trustworthy years after creation, regardless of personnel changes, system migrations, or disputes.

2. Governing Principles

Evidence preservation is governed by the following principles:

• Evidence is a legal artefact, not a file
• Immutability is deliberate and provable
• Integrity must be verifiable independently
• Evidence must survive hostile scrutiny
• Absence of evidence is treated as failure

Accordingly, no evidence may rely on trust alone.

3. Definition of Evidence

For the purposes of this platform, evidence includes but is not limited to:

• Governance documents
• Legal agreements
• Compliance submissions
• Supplier certifications
• Pricing snapshots
• Payment records
• Audit logs
• Shipping records
• Incident reports
• System events
• Communications linked to cases

Any artefact capable of influencing decisions, outcomes, or liability is evidence.

4. Evidence States

All evidence exists in one of the following states:

• Draft Evidence — Under creation, not yet authoritative
• Recorded Evidence — Captured and timestamped
• Locked Evidence — Immutable and hash-verified
• Superseded Evidence — Replaced but retained
• Archived Evidence — Retained under long-term policy

Once evidence reaches Locked, it may never be altered.

5. Immutability Requirements

The following immutability requirements are mandatory:

• Evidence content must not be editable once locked
• File-level write protection must be applied
• Repository history must be immutable
• Evidence identifiers must be permanent
• Original creation timestamps must be preserved

Any system that allows silent alteration is non-compliant.

6. Hashing & Integrity Verification

Every locked evidence artefact must have:

• A cryptographic hash (minimum SHA-256)
• Hash recorded separately from the artefact
• Hash linked to context (case, order, supplier, incident)
• Ability to independently recompute and verify

Hash verification must be reproducible at any time.

7. Evidence Linking & Context

Evidence must never exist in isolation.

Each artefact must be explicitly linked to one or more of:

• Supplier profile
• Product record
• Order
• Payment
• Shipment
• Case (CRM, dispute, incident)
• Governance decision

Linkage metadata is itself evidence and must be immutable.

8. Evidence Packs

An Evidence Pack is a structured collection of related evidence assembled for:

• Regulatory disclosure
• Audit review
• Legal proceedings
• Insurance claims

Evidence Packs must:

• Preserve original artefacts
• Include hashes for every item
• Include a manifest file
• Be reproducible deterministically

Evidence Packs must never alter source evidence.

9. Storage & Retention

• Evidence must be stored redundantly
• Storage systems must support immutability
• Retention periods override operational convenience
• Deletion is prohibited unless legally mandated

Retention rules are defined separately and enforced strictly.

10. Access Control

• Evidence access must be role-based
• Access events must be logged
• No “admin override” for evidence alteration
• Emergency access must be auditable

Viewing evidence does not grant modification rights.

11. Breach Handling

Any compromise of evidence integrity must trigger:

• Immediate incident classification
• Scope assessment of affected artefacts
• Independent verification of unaffected evidence
• Regulatory notification if required
• Permanent audit record

Loss of evidence integrity is treated as a critical incident.

12. Enforcement

The following constitute doctrine violations:

• Editing locked evidence
• Replacing evidence without supersession
• Missing hashes
• Orphaned evidence without linkage
• Storing evidence outside the DMS

Violations must be recorded and escalated.

13. Change Control

This doctrine may only be modified through:

• Formal change request
• Legal and compliance review
• Impact analysis across all systems
• Approval by governing authority

14. Status

Status: DRAFT
Becomes immutable when approved and locked under Phase 2
