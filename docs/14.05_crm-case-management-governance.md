14.05 — CRM Case Management Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance framework for CRM-based case management, ensuring that all post-order issues, disputes, incidents, and escalations are handled in a controlled, auditable, regulator-ready manner.

The CRM is a governance instrument, not a customer service convenience layer.

2. Governing Principle

Every case is evidence.
Every action is attributable.

CRM activity must preserve decision traceability, not merely resolve issues.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Buyer support cases
• Supplier operational cases
• Compliance and regulatory cases
• Payment, refund, and dispute cases
• Incident and breach-related cases

Out of scope:

• Informal communications outside the platform
• External ticketing systems not integrated into the CRM

4. Case Creation Rules

A case may be created only:

• By a system event, or
• By an authenticated user action, or
• By an authorised administrator

All cases must have a defined origin trigger.

5. Case Classification Model

Every case must be classified by:

• Case type (support, dispute, compliance, incident)
• Severity level
• Affected entities (buyer, supplier, product, order)
• Regulatory exposure flag

Classification is mandatory and immutable.

6. Severity Levels

Severity levels must be predefined and limited to:

• Informational
• Operational
• Financial
• Compliance-critical
• Regulatory-critical

Severity determines escalation paths.

7. Case State Machine

Cases must follow a governed lifecycle:

Created → Triaged → In Progress → Resolution Proposed → Closed

State transitions must be explicit and logged.

8. Ownership & Assignment

Each case must have:

• A single accountable owner
• Clear role-based permissions
• Time-bound ownership rules

Ownership changes are audited.

9. Evidence Attachment Governance

Cases may include:

• Documents
• Messages
• System logs
• Screenshots
• Generated evidence packs

Evidence is append-only.

10. Communication Rules

All case communications must:

• Occur within the platform
• Be timestamped
• Be role-scoped
• Be retained

Off-platform communications are prohibited.

11. Automation Triggers

Cases may be auto-created by:

• Failed payments
• Shipping exceptions
• Compliance revocations
• Security alerts

Automated cases must be identifiable.

12. Escalation Rules

Escalation occurs when:

• SLA thresholds are breached
• Severity increases
• Regulatory risk is detected

Escalation paths are predefined.

13. Resolution Governance

A case may be closed only if:

• Resolution criteria are met
• Evidence is complete
• Required approvals are recorded

Closure without resolution is prohibited.

14. Regulatory & Legal Holds

Cases may be flagged as:

• Regulator hold
• Legal hold

Held cases cannot be closed or altered.

15. Audit Logging

Every case action must log:

• Actor identity
• Action performed
• Timestamp
• Previous and new state

Logs are immutable.

16. Reporting & Oversight

The system must support:

• Case volume analytics
• SLA compliance reports
• Regulator-ready summaries

Reports must reflect system truth.

17. Data Retention

Case records must be retained:

• For regulatory minimums, or
• For the life of the platform

Deletion requires formal approval.

18. Change Control

Changes affecting:

• Case classification
• Severity definitions
• Escalation logic

Require governance approval.

19. Enforcement Status

This governance is:

• Mandatory
• Enforced by system design
• Not bypassable

Manual overrides are prohibited.
