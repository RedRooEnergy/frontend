17.01 — Security Hardening Governance Framework
1. Purpose

This document establishes the authoritative security hardening governance framework for the platform. It defines how security controls are selected, enforced, monitored, and reviewed to protect the platform against technical, operational, and adversarial threats.

Security hardening is treated as a continuous governance discipline, not a one-time activity.

2. Governing Principle

Security is enforced by design, verified continuously, and never assumed.

All security controls must be deliberate, testable, and auditable.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Application code (frontend and backend)
• Infrastructure and hosting environments
• CI/CD pipelines
• Dependencies and third-party services
• Identity, authentication, and access controls

It applies across all environments: development, staging, and production.

4. Threat Model Assumptions

The platform assumes:

• External attackers will probe continuously
• Insider misuse is possible
• Supply-chain vulnerabilities will occur
• Configuration drift will happen over time

Controls must be designed to withstand these realities.

5. Security Control Domains

Security hardening controls must be implemented across the following domains:

• Identity and access management
• Application-layer security
• Infrastructure and network security
• Dependency and supply-chain security
• Data protection and encryption
• Monitoring, logging, and alerting

No domain may be omitted.

6. Identity & Access Hardening

Mandatory controls include:

• Strong authentication enforcement
• Role-based access control (RBAC)
• Least-privilege role assignment
• Session expiry and rotation policies
• Protection against credential reuse

Privilege escalation paths must be explicitly documented and blocked.

7. Application Security Controls

The platform must enforce:

• Input validation and sanitisation
• Protection against injection attacks
• CSRF and XSS protections
• Secure file upload handling
• Strict API schema validation

Security checks must occur server-side; client-side controls are insufficient.

8. Infrastructure Security

Infrastructure hardening includes:

• Firewall and network segmentation
• Secure service-to-service communication
• Enforced TLS everywhere
• Secrets isolation and rotation
• No public exposure of internal services

Infrastructure must be treated as hostile by default.

9. Dependency & Supply-Chain Security

Controls include:

• Continuous dependency scanning
• Explicit version pinning
• Vulnerability severity thresholds
• Formal override documentation for accepted risk
• Immediate remediation of critical issues

Unreviewed dependencies are prohibited.

10. CI/CD Security Enforcement

CI/CD pipelines must enforce:

• Static analysis and linting
• Security scans (SAST / dependency checks)
• Build failure on high-risk findings
• Immutable build artefacts
• Provenance traceability

No manual bypass is permitted.

11. Data Protection & Encryption

Mandatory requirements:

• Encryption in transit and at rest
• Secure key management
• Segregation of sensitive data
• Explicit data access logging

Plaintext storage of sensitive data is prohibited.

12. Logging & Monitoring

Security-relevant events must be:

• Logged immutably
• Time-synchronised
• Correlated across systems

Logs must support forensic reconstruction.

13. Alerting & Detection

The system must generate alerts for:

• Authentication anomalies
• Privilege changes
• Configuration drift
• Dependency risk escalations
• Suspicious runtime behaviour

Alerts must be actionable and monitored.

14. Security Review Cadence

Security hardening reviews must occur:

• Before major releases
• After significant incidents
• On a scheduled periodic basis

Review outcomes must be documented and retained.

15. Roles & Accountability

Security responsibilities must be explicitly assigned for:

• Policy ownership
• Control implementation
• Monitoring and response
• Risk acceptance decisions

Shared responsibility without ownership is prohibited.

16. Documentation & Evidence

All security controls must be:

• Documented
• Traceable to risks
• Verifiable through evidence

Undocumented controls are treated as non-existent.

17. Exception Handling

Security exceptions:

• Require formal justification
• Must be time-bound
• Must include mitigation measures

Permanent exceptions are prohibited.

18. Continuous Improvement

Security hardening is iterative.

Lessons from:

• Incidents
• Penetration testing
• Audit findings

must feed back into control refinement.
