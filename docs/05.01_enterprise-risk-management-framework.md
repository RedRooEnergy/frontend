05.01 — Enterprise Risk Management Framework
1. Purpose

This document establishes the enterprise risk management (ERM) framework governing identification, assessment, control, monitoring, and escalation of risks across the marketplace.

Risk management is a foundational design constraint, not an operational afterthought.

2. Risk Governance Objectives

The ERM framework exists to:

• Protect regulatory compliance
• Preserve financial integrity
• Reduce legal exposure
• Ensure operational continuity
• Maintain audit defensibility

Risk decisions must always favour system correctness over convenience.

3. Risk Scope

This framework applies to all platform domains, including:

• Legal and corporate structure
• Regulatory compliance
• Commercial and pricing logic
• Payments, escrow, and settlement
• Supplier onboarding and operations
• Product and catalogue governance
• Freight, customs, and logistics
• Data integrity and security
• Infrastructure reliability
• Third-party integrations

No system component is out of scope.

4. Risk Categories

Risks are classified into the following categories:

• Regulatory risk
• Legal and contractual risk
• Financial risk
• Operational risk
• Technical and infrastructure risk
• Cybersecurity risk
• Third-party dependency risk
• Reputational risk

Each risk must be categorised at creation.

5. Risk Identification

Risks may be identified through:

• Design reviews
• Compliance mapping
• Incident analysis
• Audit findings
• Monitoring alerts
• Third-party notifications

Risk identification is continuous.

6. Risk Assessment Model

Each risk must be assessed using:

• Likelihood (Low / Medium / High)
• Impact (Low / Medium / High)
• Detectability (High / Medium / Low)

An overall risk rating is derived and recorded.

7. Risk Acceptance Rules

The platform applies the following rules:

• High-impact risks cannot be accepted without mitigation
• Regulatory risks cannot be accepted without legal sign-off
• Financial risks affecting funds flow require executive approval
• Unmitigated critical risks block deployment

Risk acceptance decisions must be documented.

8. Risk Controls

Controls may include:

• Governance rules
• Technical enforcement
• Process constraints
• Automated blocking logic
• Monitoring and alerting

Controls must be mapped directly to risks.

9. Risk Ownership

Every risk must have:

• A named risk owner
• A responsible governance domain
• Defined escalation authority

Unowned risks are invalid.

10. Risk Register Integration

All identified risks must be recorded in the authoritative risk register, including:

• Risk ID
• Description
• Category
• Assessment scores
• Controls
• Status
• Review cadence

The risk register is immutable once approved.

11. Monitoring & Review

Risks must be:

• Reviewed on a defined schedule
• Re-assessed after incidents or changes
• Updated following regulatory changes

Dormant risks are still reviewed.

12. Risk Escalation

Risks exceeding defined thresholds must be escalated according to:

• Impact severity
• Regulatory exposure
• Financial exposure

Escalation paths are mandatory and time-bound.

13. Audit & Evidence

All risk decisions must generate:

• Audit logs
• Decision records
• Evidence of control effectiveness

Risk governance must be regulator-defensible.

14. Change Control

Changes to this framework require:

• Governance approval
• Legal review (where applicable)
• Versioned documentation update
