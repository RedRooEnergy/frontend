01.03 — Jurisdictional & Regulatory Assumptions

Project Name: RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace
Document Type: Foundational Governance Artefact
Phase: Phase 1 — Master Project Definition
Status: DRAFT (to be approved and locked)
Change Control: Not active (pre-baseline)

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the jurisdictional, legal, and regulatory assumptions under which the RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace is designed, built, and operated.

These assumptions are foundational constraints, not implementation details.
They determine:

Which laws apply

Which regulators have authority

Which compliance regimes must be enforced

How data, payments, and goods must be treated

If these assumptions change, material parts of the platform must be reviewed or rebuilt.

2. Primary Jurisdiction of Operation
2.1 Marketplace Operator Jurisdiction

The marketplace operator is assumed to be:

Incorporated and domiciled in Australia

Subject to Australian federal and state law

Operating primarily within Queensland for regulatory alignment

Accordingly, the platform assumes applicability of:

Australian Corporations Act

Australian Consumer Law (ACL)

Australian taxation and GST regimes

Australian privacy and data protection laws

3. Buyer Jurisdiction Assumptions
3.1 Default Buyer Location

The platform is initially designed for buyers who are:

Located in Australia

Purchasing goods for delivery and use within Australia

Buyer-facing flows, disclosures, pricing, and protections are aligned to Australian legal expectations.

3.2 Consumer vs Commercial Buyers

The platform distinguishes between:

Consumer buyers (ACL-protected)

Commercial buyers (contractual protections)

Buyer classification affects:

Disclosure requirements

Refund and return handling

Contract formation logic

4. Supplier Jurisdiction Assumptions
4.1 Supplier Location

The platform assumes suppliers may be:

Domestic (Australian entities)

International (including but not limited to manufacturers based in Asia)

Supplier location does not reduce compliance obligations.

4.2 Supplier Obligations

All suppliers, regardless of location, are assumed to be subject to:

Australian import and customs law for goods entering Australia

Australian product compliance regimes applicable to the goods sold

Platform-enforced contractual and evidentiary obligations

No supplier is exempt due to geography.

5. Regulatory Domains Assumed In Scope

The platform is built on the assumption that the following regulatory domains apply and must be enforced where relevant:

5.1 Product Compliance

Including but not limited to:

Electrical and energy equipment standards

Certification and marking requirements

Evidence retention obligations

Compliance is treated as a precondition to sale, not a post-sale concern.

5.2 Import, Customs, and Taxation

Including:

Australian Border Force requirements

HS classification

Duties and tariffs

Goods and Services Tax (GST)

Delivered-Duty-Paid (DDP) obligations

The platform assumes responsibility for calculation, traceability, and auditability, not physical clearance execution.

5.3 Payments and Financial Regulation

Including:

Payment services regulation

Escrow and settlement handling

Anti-money laundering (AML) and KYC obligations (via providers)

Transaction traceability

The platform relies on regulated payment providers but remains responsible for correct orchestration and recordkeeping.

5.4 Data Protection and Records

Including:

Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)

Data retention expectations for commercial and regulatory records

Lawful disclosure obligations

Records are assumed to be discoverable, preservable, and exportable.

6. Explicit Regulatory Exclusions

Unless explicitly added via change control, the platform does not assume responsibility for:

Non-Australian consumer protection regimes

Foreign tax collection outside import context

Installation or on-site compliance enforcement

Licensing regimes unrelated to product sale and import

These may be added later as extensions but are not assumed by default.

7. Enforcement Philosophy

The platform is designed under the assumption that:

Regulatory obligations can and should be codified

Manual compliance reliance is insufficient

Audit defensibility is a first-class requirement

Where regulation is ambiguous, the platform assumes a conservative, evidence-heavy interpretation.

8. Impact on Architecture and Design

These assumptions directly constrain:

Data model design

Document control systems

Pricing and tax logic

Freight and customs calculations

Audit and reporting exports

Any deviation requires formal reassessment of this document.

9. Change Sensitivity

Changes to any of the following are considered high-impact:

Primary operating jurisdiction

Buyer country scope

Supplier jurisdiction rules

Applicable regulatory regimes

Such changes require:

Formal change request

Legal review

Architectural impact assessment

Explicit approval

10. Approval and Locking

Upon approval, this document shall be:

Marked APPROVED

Version-locked

Used as the authoritative jurisdictional reference

Governed under formal change control
