15.06 — Careers & Recruitment Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines governance for the Careers system, including public job listings, application intake, file uploads, and administrative review.

Recruitment data is treated as controlled operational data and must be handled with the same discipline as other marketplace records.

2. Governing Principles

Recruitment activity must be:

• Transparent to applicants
• Controlled by defined workflows
• Auditable and traceable
• Minimal in data collection

No informal or off-platform recruitment channels are permitted for governed roles.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• /careers public listing and job detail pages
• Application submissions (job and talent pool)
• Attachment uploads and storage
• Admin careers dashboards and review workflows

Out of scope:

• Third-party recruiting systems not integrated with RedRooEnergy

4. Application Intake Rules

All applications must:

• Capture required identity and contact fields
• Record region and work rights
• Include applicant consent confirmation
• Enforce rate limiting and spam controls

Honeypot fields are mandatory. Optional CAPTCHA may be enabled without redesign.

5. Attachment Controls

Attachments must comply with:

• Maximum file size: 20 MB per file
• Allowed formats: PDF, DOC, DOCX, PAGES (optional: RTF, TXT)
• File metadata captured at upload
• Virus scan queue entry recorded at ingestion

Files must not be stored inside the database.

6. Storage & Environment Controls

Production storage must use object storage with pre-signed uploads.
Local development may use local storage for testing.

Local storage is not permitted for production or public deployments.

7. Administrative Review Governance

Admin review is read/write only for:

• Application status updates
• Internal notes

Admin users must not edit applicant-submitted fields.
Status changes must be tracked in a history log.

8. Notifications

Applicants must receive:

• Submission confirmation
• Reference ID

Admins must receive:

• New application notification

Notifications must not imply hiring decisions or timelines.

9. Retention & Privacy

Recruitment data is subject to the platform data retention doctrine.
Access is restricted to authorised admin roles and must be logged.

Applicant data must not be used for marketing without explicit consent.

10. Regional Readiness

The Careers system must support:

• Australia
• New Zealand
• China
• Oceania
