04.02 — Regulatory Obligations Classification & Applicability Model
1. Purpose

This document classifies all identified regulatory regimes into explicit obligation types and maps their applicability across platform actors and system states.

Its purpose is to:

• Eliminate ambiguity over responsibility
• Prevent regulatory gaps between parties
• Define obligation ownership
• Enable deterministic compliance enforcement
• Provide the structural basis for the Compliance Matrix

This document does not define enforcement controls.
It defines who is obligated and under what conditions.

2. Regulated Actors

All regulatory obligations apply to one or more of the following actors:

• Marketplace Operator
• Supplier
• Buyer
• Service Partner (logistics, payment, certification)
• Platform System (automated obligations)

No obligation exists without a named accountable actor.

3. Obligation Classes

All regulatory obligations are categorised into the following immutable classes:

Pre-Participation Obligations

Pre-Transaction Obligations

Point-of-Sale Obligations

Post-Transaction Obligations

Ongoing Operational Obligations

Incident-Triggered Obligations

Each obligation must belong to exactly one class.

4. Pre-Participation Obligations

Obligations that must be satisfied before an actor may access or operate on the platform.

Examples include:

• Legal entity verification
• Identity and authority checks
• Supplier eligibility
• Certification prerequisites

Failure blocks platform access.

5. Pre-Transaction Obligations

Obligations that must be satisfied before a product or service may be offered.

Examples include:

• Product certification
• Regulatory approvals
• Disclosure completeness
• Pricing rule compliance

Failure blocks listing visibility.

6. Point-of-Sale Obligations

Obligations that must be satisfied at the moment of transaction execution.

Examples include:

• Pricing accuracy
• Tax calculation
• Payment compliance
• Contract formation validity

Failure blocks checkout.

7. Post-Transaction Obligations

Obligations triggered after a transaction is completed.

Examples include:

• Delivery obligations
• Documentation provision
• Consumer rights enforcement
• Refund eligibility

Failure triggers remedies.

8. Ongoing Operational Obligations

Obligations that persist throughout platform operation.

Examples include:

• Record retention
• Audit readiness
• Regulatory reporting
• Monitoring and controls

Failure escalates risk.

9. Incident-Triggered Obligations

Obligations activated by specific events.

Examples include:

• Security breaches
• Product non-compliance
• Regulatory inquiries
• Dispute escalation

Failure increases legal exposure.

10. Obligation Ownership Rules

Each obligation must declare:

• Primary accountable actor
• Secondary accountable actor (if any)
• Platform enforcement responsibility

No shared ambiguity is permitted.

11. Jurisdictional Applicability

Obligations are tagged by jurisdiction:

• Mandatory (cannot be waived)
• Conditional (context-dependent)
• Excluded (explicitly non-applicable)

Jurisdictional tags are immutable once applied.

12. Obligation Severity Levels

Each obligation is assigned a severity tier:

• Critical (blocks operation)
• High (blocks transactions)
• Medium (requires remediation)
• Low (monitoring required)

Severity drives enforcement priority.

13. Compliance Evidence Expectations

Each obligation must be evidentiary:

• Documentary
• System-generated
• Third-party verified

No obligation exists without evidence capability.

14. Relationship to Compliance Matrix

This document is the structural precursor to:

• Regulation → Obligation mapping
• Obligation → Control mapping

It feeds directly into 04.03 — Compliance Matrix Definition.
