05.05 — Security Hardening & Monitoring Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory security hardening standards and continuous monitoring governance for the marketplace platform.

Security hardening and monitoring are preventive and detective controls, not optional operational enhancements.

2. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Application services (frontend and backend)
• Infrastructure and hosting environments
• Databases and storage systems
• CI/CD pipelines and build artefacts
• Third-party integrations
• Administrative and operational tooling

No runtime component is excluded.

3. Hardening Doctrine

All systems must be hardened according to the following principles:

• Minimal attack surface
• Explicitly enabled services only
• Secure-by-default configurations
• Environment isolation
• Immutable infrastructure where feasible

Unhardened components are non-compliant.

4. Application Hardening

Application-level hardening includes:

• Strict input validation
• Output encoding
• Authentication enforcement
• Authorisation checks at every boundary
• Rate limiting and abuse prevention

Application bypass paths are prohibited.

5. Infrastructure Hardening

Infrastructure must enforce:

• Network segmentation
• Firewall rules with least privilege
• Secure transport (TLS) everywhere
• Hardened OS images
• Disabled unused ports and services

Infrastructure changes require approval.

6. Dependency and Runtime Hardening

The platform mandates:

• Removal of unused dependencies
• Runtime configuration locking
• Container image hardening (if applicable)
• Explicit runtime permissions

Dynamic runtime mutation is restricted.

7. Monitoring Objectives

Monitoring exists to:

• Detect anomalies
• Identify failures early
• Support incident response
• Provide audit evidence
• Demonstrate control effectiveness

Monitoring is continuous.

8. Mandatory Monitoring Domains

The following must be monitored:

• Authentication and access events
• Payment and settlement flows
• Compliance state transitions
• Data integrity violations
• Infrastructure health
• Third-party integration availability

Blind spots are unacceptable.

9. Alerting Rules

Alerts must be:

• Threshold-based
• Severity-classified
• Actionable
• Time-bound

Noise without actionability is prohibited.

10. Log Management

Logs must be:

• Centralised
• Time-synchronised
• Tamper-resistant
• Retained per retention doctrine

Logs are legal records.

11. Metrics and Health Checks

The platform must expose:

• Service health endpoints
• Performance metrics
• Error rates
• Latency indicators

Health degradation triggers escalation.

12. Monitoring Tooling Governance

Monitoring tools must:

• Be approved
• Be access-controlled
• Produce exportable evidence
• Integrate with incident records

Tool changes require governance approval.

13. Incident Integration

Monitoring events that exceed thresholds must:

• Generate incident records
• Trigger escalation paths
• Link to affected risks and controls

Automated detection feeds governance.

14. Review & Continuous Improvement

Hardening and monitoring controls must be:

• Reviewed periodically
• Updated after incidents
• Validated during audits

Stale controls are treated as failures.

15. Change Control

Changes to hardening or monitoring require:

• Risk assessment
• Approval by security authority
• Versioned documentation updates

Emergency changes remain auditable.

16. Enforcement Rules

• No production deployment without monitoring coverage
• No exposed services without approval
• No disabled alerts without justification
• No log deletion outside retention rules

Violations block progression.
