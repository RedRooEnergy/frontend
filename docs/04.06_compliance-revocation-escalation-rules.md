04.06 — Compliance Revocation & Escalation Rules
1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory rules for revoking supplier or product compliance and the escalation pathways that follow.

Revocation is not discretionary. It is a governed system response to verified conditions.

2. Governing Principle

Compliance revocation must be:

• Deterministic
• Immediate where risk exists
• Proportionate to severity
• Fully auditable

No commercial consideration may delay revocation.

3. Revocation Triggers

Compliance revocation is triggered when one or more of the following occur:

• Mandatory certification expiry
• Certification invalidation or withdrawal
• Regulator-issued prohibition or notice
• Verified falsification of documents
• Repeated material non-compliance
• Critical incident outcome (see Phase 5)

Triggers are system-detected or regulator-confirmed.

4. Revocation Scope

Revocation may apply to:

• Supplier-level compliance
• Product-level compliance
• Jurisdictional scope only

The narrowest safe scope is applied first, unless risk dictates otherwise.

5. Revocation Actions

Upon revocation, the system must automatically:

• Set compliance state to REVOKED or SUSPENDED
• Remove affected products from catalogues
• Block new orders
• Hold unsettled payments
• Flag all linked records for review

Actions are atomic and non-reversible without revalidation.

6. Escalation Levels

Escalation is classified into the following levels:

Level 1 — Administrative
• Certificate expiry
• Missing renewal
• Minor documentation issues

Level 2 — Regulatory Risk
• Regulator queries
• Conditional non-compliance
• Jurisdictional conflicts

Level 3 — Critical
• Legal prohibition
• Fraud or falsification
• Safety or systemic risk

Each level has predefined response timelines.

7. Escalation Pathways

Escalation routes include:

• Internal compliance review
• Legal consultation trigger
• Regulator notification
• Incident response activation

Paths are selected based on severity level.

8. Supplier Notification Rules

Suppliers must be notified of:

• Revocation reason
• Effective timestamp
• Scope of impact
• Required remediation steps

Notifications are informational only; they do not pause enforcement.

9. Reinstatement Conditions

Reinstatement is only permitted if:

• All deficiencies are remedied
• New evidence is submitted
• Full revalidation is completed
• No regulator prohibition exists

Reinstatement creates a new compliance state version.

10. Audit & Evidence Requirements

Every revocation event must record:

• Trigger source
• Evidence references
• Decision authority (system/manual)
• Impact summary
• Escalation level

Records are immutable and regulator-exportable.

11. Manual Intervention Limits

Manual intervention is restricted to:

• Escalation classification
• Regulator liaison logging
• Reinstatement review

Manual override of revocation is prohibited.

12. Change Control

Any change to revocation or escalation rules requires:

• Legal sign-off
• Regulatory impact assessment
• Versioned documentation update
