09.03 — Supplier Certification & Compliance Validation
1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory certification, regulatory compliance, and validation rules that suppliers must satisfy before they may submit products, appear in catalogues, or participate in commercial activity.

Compliance validation is continuous, not a one-time gate.

2. Compliance Doctrine

No valid certification. No compliant supplier. No commerce.

The platform must ensure that:

• Required certifications are identified per jurisdiction and product class
• Evidence is verified, current, and authentic
• Expired or revoked certifications immediately restrict capability
• All decisions are immutable and auditable

Compliance is enforced by system controls, not declarations.

3. Scope

This document governs:

• Supplier-level regulatory certifications
• Product-class eligibility prerequisites
• Evidence submission and validation
• Expiry monitoring and enforcement
• Compliance-driven restriction and escalation

Out of scope:

• Product-specific certification attachment (Phase 10)
• Commercial rules (Phase 6)
• Payments (Phase 12)

4. Certification Taxonomy

Certifications are classified as:

• Mandatory — Required to operate
• Conditional — Required for specific product classes
• Jurisdiction-Specific — Required based on destination market

Each certification type must be mapped in the Compliance Matrix.

5. Evidence Requirements

Each certification submission must include:

• Issuing authority
• Certificate identifier
• Scope of validity
• Jurisdiction(s) covered
• Issue date
• Expiry date

Incomplete submissions are rejected automatically.

6. Acceptable Evidence Sources

Accepted evidence includes:

• Government or regulator-issued certificates
• Accredited conformity bodies
• Recognised testing authorities

Self-issued or unverifiable certificates are prohibited.

7. Validation States

Certification validation states:

• Submitted
• Under Review
• Valid
• Rejected
• Expired
• Revoked

Only Valid certifications satisfy compliance requirements.

8. Validation Workflow

Supplier submits certification evidence

System checks completeness and format

Reviewer verifies authenticity

Scope and jurisdiction evaluated

Validation decision recorded

All steps are governed and audited.

9. Continuous Compliance Monitoring

The system must:

• Monitor expiry dates
• Trigger pre-expiry warnings
• Automatically restrict capability on expiry
• Record revocations

Compliance degradation is enforced immediately.

10. Restriction Semantics

On compliance failure or expiry:

• Product submission is blocked
• Catalogue visibility may be suspended
• Payments are prohibited
• Existing orders follow governed exception paths

No silent degradation is permitted.

11. Evidence Handling & Immutability

Certification documents:

• Are stored in the DMS
• Are versioned per submission
• Are hash-verified
• Cannot be modified or deleted

Superseded certifications remain retained.

12. Role & Authority Constraints

Only roles explicitly authorised may validate certifications:

• COMPLIANCE_REVIEWER
• REGULATORY_APPROVER

Automated approval is prohibited unless explicitly governed.

13. Audit & Evidence

Each validation decision logs:

• Actor identity
• Certification referenced
• Decision outcome
• Justification
• Timestamp

Audit records are immutable and exportable.

14. Fraud & Abuse Handling

The system must detect:

• Forged certificates
• Re-used certificate identifiers
• Jurisdictional mismatches
• Pattern-based evasion attempts

Findings escalate under incident governance.

15. Extension Interaction Rules

Downstream extensions may:

• Query compliance state
• Subscribe to compliance events

They may not:

• Override compliance decisions
• Modify certification records

Compliance authority remains centralised.

16. Dependency Enforcement

Compliance validation depends on:

• Verified legal identity (09.02)
• Locked Compliance Matrix (Phase 4)

If dependencies are invalid, validation must fail.

17. Status

Status: DRAFT
Phase: 9 — Supplier Onboarding & Governance
Upstream Dependency:
• 09.02 — Supplier Identity & Legal Verification

Downstream Dependencies:
• 09.04 — Supplier Approval & Revocation Workflow
• Phase 10 — Product & Catalogue Governance
