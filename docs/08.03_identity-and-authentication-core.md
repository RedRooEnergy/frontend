08.03 — Identity & Authentication Core
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative identity and authentication model enforced by the Immutable Core. Identity is the foundation of all governance, auditability, authorization, and liability attribution within the platform.

No action, state change, or system event may occur without a valid, attributable identity.

2. Core Identity Doctrine

Identity precedes authority. Authority precedes action. Action precedes audit.

The Core identity system must guarantee:

• Unique, persistent identities
• Deterministic authentication outcomes
• Non-repudiation of actions
• Explicit separation of identity and role
• Compatibility with regulatory and audit scrutiny

Identity is treated as a legal-grade system primitive, not a convenience feature.

3. Identity Types

The Core supports the following immutable identity classes:

• Human User Identity
• System Identity (services, schedulers, background jobs)
• Integration Identity (external systems, webhooks, APIs)

Each identity type is governed by the same immutability and audit rules.

4. Identity Record Structure (Canonical)

Every identity record must contain:

• identity_id (globally unique, immutable)
• identity_type (human | system | integration)
• status (active | suspended | revoked)
• created_at_utc
• created_by_identity_id
• revocation_reference (if applicable)
• identity_hash (deterministic, immutable)

Identity records are write-once except for status transitions governed by change control.

5. Identity Lifecycle

Identity lifecycle states:

• Created → Active → Suspended → Revoked

Rules:

• Revoked identities can never be reactivated
• Suspensions are reversible only via governed action
• Identity deletion is prohibited

All transitions emit mandatory audit events.

6. Authentication Scope

Authentication is limited strictly to identity verification.

Authentication does not:
• Grant permissions
• Assign roles
• Imply authority

Authentication confirms who is acting — nothing more.

7. Supported Authentication Mechanisms

The Core must support pluggable authentication providers, including:

• Credential-based authentication
• Token-based authentication
• Certificate-based authentication
• Federated identity providers (future extension)

All mechanisms must map to a single immutable identity_id.

8. Authentication Outcome Rules

Authentication attempts result in exactly one outcome:

• Success
• Failure
• Blocked

All outcomes must be audited, including failed and blocked attempts.

Silent failures are prohibited.

9. Session Handling

Sessions are:

• Ephemeral
• Non-authoritative
• Bound to an identity

Session compromise does not alter identity records.

Session creation and termination must emit audit events.

10. Credential Governance

Credentials are:

• Stored separately from identity records
• Rotatable without identity mutation
• Revocable independently

Credential updates do not modify identity hashes.

11. Identity Immutability Rules

Once created:

• identity_id cannot change
• Identity type cannot change
• Historical identity state is preserved

Only lifecycle status may transition under governance.

12. Identity Revocation

Revocation rules:

• Revoked identities immediately lose authentication ability
• Historical audit records remain valid
• Revocation requires documented justification

Revocation events are irreversible.

13. System & Integration Identities

System and integration identities must:

• Be explicitly registered
• Have defined scopes
• Use non-interactive authentication mechanisms

Shared credentials are prohibited.

14. Failure & Abuse Handling

The Core must:

• Detect repeated failed authentication attempts
• Escalate suspicious patterns
• Log all security-relevant authentication events

Blocking decisions must be auditable.

15. Interaction With Authorization (RBAC)

Identity resolution is a prerequisite for:

• Role evaluation
• Permission checks
• Governance enforcement

Authorization logic is defined separately and must never be embedded in authentication.

16. Extension Interaction

Extensions may:

• Request identity verification
• Consume authenticated identity context

Extensions may not:

• Create identities
• Authenticate identities
• Override authentication outcomes

Identity authority remains Core-only.

17. Non-Functional Guarantees

The identity system prioritises:

• Correctness over convenience
• Explicitness over flexibility
• Traceability over speed
