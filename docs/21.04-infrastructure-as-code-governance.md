21.04 — Infrastructure-as-Code Governance & Tooling Selection

Document ID: 21.04
Title: Infrastructure-as-Code Governance & Tooling Selection
Status: DRAFT → LOCKED UPON APPROVAL
Governing Phase: Phase 21 — Change Control & Post-Baseline Execution

1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) governance framework for the platform, including approved tooling, enforcement rules, review controls, and audit requirements.

Infrastructure MUST be reproducible, reviewable, and reversible.

2. Governance Position

The platform SHALL use Infrastructure-as-Code exclusively.

The following are explicitly prohibited:

Manual console changes

One-off CLI provisioning

Hot-fix infrastructure edits

Drift outside source control

3. Approved IaC Tooling
3.1 Primary Tool

Terraform is the approved Infrastructure-as-Code engine.

Rationale:

Declarative

Provider-agnostic

State-managed

Audit-friendly

Rollback-capable

No alternative tools are permitted without change control.

4. Repository Structure (Mandatory)

Infrastructure code SHALL reside in a dedicated repository or top-level folder:

/infrastructure
  /modules
  /environments
    /dev
    /staging
    /production
  /policies


Mixing application code and infrastructure code is forbidden.

5. Environment Separation Rules

Each environment has isolated state

No shared credentials

No cross-environment apply

Promotion occurs via code, not copying state

6. State Management

Remote state is mandatory

State must be encrypted

State access is restricted

State modification is logged

State loss is treated as a SEV-1 incident.

7. Change Control Enforcement

All IaC changes MUST:

Reference an approved Change Control Record (CCR)

Be committed to source control

Pass automated validation

Receive manual approval

Be applied through pipeline only

Direct terraform apply from developer machines is forbidden for staging and production.

8. Validation & Safeguards

Mandatory safeguards include:

Plan review before apply

Destructive change warnings

Explicit approvals for production

Drift detection checks

Any failure halts progression.

9. Rollback Strategy

Rollback SHALL be performed by:

Reverting IaC code

Re-applying via pipeline

Preserving logs and state

Manual rollback is forbidden unless documented as emergency action.

10. Audit & Evidence

The following evidence SHALL be retained:

Terraform plans

Apply logs

Approval records

State history

Drift detection reports

Evidence is stored under Infrastructure Audit Records.

11. Approval & Lock

Upon approval, this document becomes immutable.
