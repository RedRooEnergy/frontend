17.03 — Monitoring, Alerting & Incident Detection Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative governance framework for monitoring, alerting, and incident detection across the platform. It ensures that abnormal behaviour, security events, operational degradation, and governance breaches are detected early, recorded immutably, and escalated in a controlled manner.

Detection is treated as a first-class control, not an operational convenience.

2. Governing Principle

If an event is not observable, it is unmanaged risk.

Every material system event must be detectable, attributable, and auditable.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Application runtime behaviour
• Security-relevant events
• Infrastructure health
• Data integrity signals
• Governance rule enforcement failures

It spans development, staging, and production environments, with environment-aware thresholds.

4. Event Taxonomy

Events must be classified into the following categories:

• Informational
• Warning
• Security Event
• Operational Degradation
• Incident Candidate
• Confirmed Incident

Each event must carry a severity and confidence level.

5. Monitoring Domains

Monitoring must cover, at minimum:

• Authentication and access patterns
• API request integrity and error rates
• Background job execution
• Webhook delivery and verification
• Database health and integrity
• Queue depth and latency
• Configuration drift

No critical subsystem may operate without monitoring coverage.

6. Security Event Detection

The platform must detect:

• Authentication anomalies
• Privilege changes
• Suspicious access patterns
• Repeated validation failures
• Unauthorised configuration changes

Security signals must be isolated from application noise.

7. Integrity & Governance Signals

Monitoring must detect:

• Pricing snapshot mismatches
• Audit log write failures
• Document immutability violations
• Governance rule bypass attempts

Integrity failures are treated as high-severity events.

8. Alerting Rules

Alerts must be:

• Threshold-based where possible
• Behaviour-based where appropriate
• Environment-scoped
• Actionable

Alert storms and noisy alerts are governance failures.

9. Alert Severity Levels

Alerts must be categorised as:

• Critical — Immediate response required
• High — Rapid investigation required
• Medium — Tracked and reviewed
• Low — Logged for trend analysis

Severity mapping must be consistent and documented.

10. Escalation Pathways

Each alert level must define:

• Primary responder
• Escalation timeframe
• Secondary authority
• Regulator notification triggers

Undefined escalation paths are prohibited.

11. Incident Detection Logic

An incident is declared when:

• Multiple corroborating signals occur, or
• A single critical integrity or security breach is detected

Incident declaration must be logged immutably.

12. Correlation & Context

Monitoring systems must support:

• Event correlation across services
• Timeline reconstruction
• Causal analysis

Isolated alerts without context are insufficient.

13. Evidence Generation

All monitoring and alerting outputs must generate:

• Immutable logs
• Timestamped records
• System identifiers

These artefacts feed incident response and audit workflows.

14. Response Automation (Bounded)

Automation may be used to:

• Quarantine affected components
• Temporarily disable integrations
• Rate-limit suspicious actors

Automation must never perform irreversible actions.

15. False Positive Management

False positives must be:

• Reviewed
• Documented
• Used to refine detection rules

Silencing alerts without analysis is prohibited.

16. Reporting & Oversight

Monitoring effectiveness must be reviewed via:

• Alert volume metrics
• Mean time to detection
• Incident detection accuracy

Reports feed governance and board oversight.

17. Failure Scenarios

Monitoring systems themselves must be monitored.

Failure to detect is treated as a critical system risk.
