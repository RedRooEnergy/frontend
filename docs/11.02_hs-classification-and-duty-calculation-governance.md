11.02 — HS Classification & Duty Calculation Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative governance rules for Harmonized System (HS) classification and customs duty calculation within the marketplace.

HS classification is treated as a regulated compliance artefact, not a descriptive attribute. Duty calculation is treated as a financial control, not an estimate.

Incorrect classification or duty handling constitutes a regulatory breach.

2. Governing Principle

If HS classification is incorrect or unverifiable, the product must not transact.

The platform enforces:

• Single authoritative HS code per product
• Deterministic duty and tax calculation
• Full audit traceability
• Jurisdiction-aware compliance

No manual overrides are permitted outside formal change control.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• HS code assignment
• HS validation rules
• Duty calculation logic
• Trade agreement application
• Classification change handling
• Audit and evidence retention

Out of scope:

• Freight pricing mechanics (11.01)
• Payment execution (Phase 12)

4. HS Code Authority Model

Each product must have:

• One primary HS code
• One country-of-origin context
• One classification authority source

Multiple HS codes per product are prohibited.

5. HS Code Assignment Rules

HS codes may be assigned only:

• During governed product submission
• By authorised supplier roles
• Using system-approved classification sources

Free-text or unverified HS codes are prohibited.

6. HS Code Validation

HS codes must be validated against:

• Destination jurisdiction tariff schedules
• Product category constraints
• Regulatory applicability

Invalid or deprecated HS codes block product publication.

7. Jurisdictional Awareness

HS classification must account for:

• Destination country
• Applicable tariff schedules
• Local statistical suffixes (where applicable)

Jurisdiction mismatch results in hard failure.

8. Duty Calculation Inputs

Duty calculation must use:

• Validated HS code
• Country of origin
• Declared customs value
• Quantity and unit measure
• Applicable trade agreements

All inputs are recorded immutably.

9. Trade Agreement Application

Trade agreements may reduce or eliminate duties only if:

• Origin criteria are satisfied
• Agreement is active for the jurisdiction
• Proof-of-origin requirements are met

Unproven claims are ignored.

10. Customs Value Governance

Customs value must:

• Reflect the transaction value
• Exclude post-import costs
• Be consistent with pricing snapshots

Artificial undervaluation is prohibited.

11. Duty Calculation Determinism

Duty calculations must be:

• Deterministic
• Reproducible
• Timestamped

Recalculation after checkout is prohibited.

12. Change Control for HS Codes

HS code changes:

• Require formal change control
• Create a new product version
• Do not retroactively affect orders

Historic orders retain original classifications.

13. Error Handling & Blocking

The system must block:

• Products without HS codes
• Orders with unresolved duty calculations
• Conflicting origin declarations

Soft warnings are not permitted.

14. Evidence & Audit Trail

For each product and order, the system must retain:

• HS classification record
• Validation source
• Duty calculation output
• Trade agreement logic applied

All records are immutable.

15. Regulatory Inspection Readiness

The system must support:

• Product-level HS inspection
• Order-level duty reconstruction
• Origin and tariff verification
• Time-based audit replay

16. Extension Interaction Rules

Other extensions may:

• Read HS and duty outputs

Extensions may not:

• Modify HS codes
• Override duty logic
• Inject alternative calculations

17. Failure Doctrine

On HS or duty failure:

• Product publication is blocked
• Checkout is blocked
• Errors are logged as compliance events

Fallback behaviour is prohibited.
