# 07.02 — Identity, Auth & Role Enforcement

Version: v0.1 DRAFT
Status: Draft

Purpose:
Define the closed role set, default-deny model, and non-bypassable identity enforcement.

Principles:
- Roles are closed and immutable at Core level.
- Default-deny applies to all actions.
- No configuration or extension may bypass identity enforcement.
