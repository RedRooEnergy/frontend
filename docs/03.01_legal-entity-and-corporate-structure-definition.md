03.01 — Legal Entity & Corporate Structure Definition
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative legal and corporate structure governing ownership, operation, contracting authority, and liability allocation for the marketplace platform.

Its objective is to ensure:

• Clear ownership of intellectual property
• Unambiguous operational responsibility
• Defined contracting entities
• Controlled liability exposure
• Regulator- and solicitor-ready clarity

No system capability, payment flow, or contractual relationship may exist without alignment to this structure.

2. Governing Principles

The legal structure is governed by the following principles:

• Ownership and operation must be separable
• Liability must be consciously allocated
• Authority must be explicit, not implied
• The platform operator is not the supplier
• Legal ambiguity creates operational risk

Accordingly, every platform action must map to a legal entity.

3. Legal Entity Roles (Conceptual Model)

The platform operates under a multi-entity model to separate risk domains.

At minimum, the following roles must be defined:

Platform Owner (IP Holder)

Marketplace Operator

Contracting Counterparty (Buyers & Suppliers)

Payment & Funds Flow Controller

Service & Support Entity (if applicable)

These roles may be fulfilled by distinct entities or consolidated where legally acceptable, but role clarity is mandatory.

4. Platform Owner (IP Holding Entity)

The Platform Owner:

• Owns all intellectual property related to the platform
• Licenses the platform to the Marketplace Operator
• Does not transact with buyers or suppliers
• Does not handle funds

Responsibilities include:

• IP protection
• Licensing governance
• Strategic control

The IP Holding Entity is insulated from day-to-day operational risk.

5. Marketplace Operator

The Marketplace Operator:

• Operates the digital platform
• Enforces governance, compliance, and rules
• Hosts infrastructure and systems
• Administers onboarding and oversight

The Operator:

• Is not the seller of goods
• Is not the manufacturer
• Acts as a governed intermediary

Operator responsibilities must be clearly distinguished from supplier obligations.

6. Contracting Counterparty

The entity that contracts with:

• Buyers (terms of marketplace use)
• Suppliers (supplier participation agreements)

This entity:

• Enters contractual relationships
• Enforces contractual terms
• Handles disputes within defined scope

Whether this is the Marketplace Operator or a dedicated contracting entity must be explicitly stated.

7. Payment & Funds Flow Entity

The entity responsible for:

• Payment provider relationships
• Escrow control
• Settlement logic
• Tax handling

This entity:

• Must meet financial compliance requirements
• Must support audit and reconciliation
• Must be clearly disclosed to buyers and suppliers

Funds flow authority must never be ambiguous.

8. Supplier Relationship Model

Suppliers:

• Are independent entities
• Are not agents of the platform
• Retain responsibility for goods and compliance
• Are subject to platform governance

Supplier agreements must explicitly define:

• Compliance obligations
• Liability boundaries
• Audit rights
• Termination and revocation rights

9. Buyer Relationship Model

Buyers:

• Contract with the platform under governed terms
• Acknowledge the platform’s intermediary role
• Agree to governed dispute resolution

Buyer agreements must clearly state:

• Who sells the goods
• Who handles payments
• What the platform guarantees — and does not

10. Liability Allocation

Liability must be explicitly allocated across:

• Platform defects
• Supplier non-compliance
• Product defects
• Delivery failures
• Payment errors
• Regulatory breaches

No “shared understanding” is acceptable — allocation must be contractual.

11. Jurisdictional Considerations

This structure must identify:

• Jurisdiction of incorporation
• Governing law
• Dispute resolution venues
• Cross-border considerations

Jurisdictional ambiguity is prohibited.

12. Enforcement

The following are explicit violations:

• System features without legal owner
• Funds flow without legal authority
• Supplier onboarding without contracting entity
• UI claims inconsistent with legal reality

Violations constitute governance breaches.

13. Change Control

Any change to legal structure requires:

• Legal review
• Risk assessment
• Contract impact analysis
• Formal approval

14. Status

Becomes immutable when approved and locked under Phase 3 governance
