01.02 — Scope Boundaries & Non-Goals Definition

Project Name: RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace
Document Type: Foundational Governance Artefact
Phase: Phase 1 — Master Project Definition
Status: DRAFT (to be approved and locked)
Change Control: Not active (pre-baseline)

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the explicit scope boundaries and non-goals of the RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace project.

Its purpose is to remove ambiguity by stating, in enforceable terms:

What the platform will do

What the platform will not do

Where responsibility ends

What categories of behaviour, feature requests, and design decisions are out of scope by default

This document exists to prevent scope creep, governance dilution, and architectural compromise.

Once approved and locked, these boundaries are treated as hard constraints, not guidelines.

2. Scope Boundary Principles

All scope decisions for this project are governed by the following principles:

Governance precedes capability

Regulatory enforceability overrides convenience

Auditability is mandatory, not optional

The Core must remain minimal and immutable

All functionality beyond the Core must exist as governed extensions

Any proposal that violates one or more of these principles is out of scope unless formally approved through change control.

3. In-Scope Domains

The following domains are explicitly in scope for this project.

3.1 Regulated Physical Goods Marketplace Infrastructure

The platform is scoped to support the sale of regulated physical goods, beginning with renewable energy hardware, where compliance, certification, customs, and taxation obligations materially affect transaction validity.

3.2 Supplier Governance and Enforcement

The platform includes governed workflows for:

Supplier identity verification

Legal entity validation

Certification submission and validation

Approval, suspension, and revocation

Continuous compliance state tracking

Suppliers cannot transact outside the constraints enforced by the system.

3.3 Product and Catalogue Governance

The platform governs:

Category definitions

Attribute templates

Mandatory compliance artefacts

Publication controls

Visibility gating

Products exist only within approved governance constraints.

3.4 Commercial and Pricing Integrity

The platform enforces:

Pricing snapshot immutability

Margin floor protection

Buyer incentives with priority rules

Supplier volume pricing

Negotiated large-order workflows

Commercial rules must be enforceable by code and auditable after the fact.

3.5 Payments, Escrow, and Settlement

The platform includes:

Multi-provider payment support

Escrow holds and conditional release

Split settlements

Refunds and disputes

Tax and GST traceability

No funds movement occurs without verified governance conditions.

3.6 Freight, Customs, and Delivery (DDP)

The platform enforces:

Delivered-Duty-Paid calculations

HS classification logic

Duties and GST

Dimensional weight

Currency normalisation

Shipping status tracking

Logistics data is treated as compliance-relevant system data.

3.7 Post-Order Governance

The platform governs:

Returns and refunds

Reviews and moderation

Notifications

CRM case handling

Evidence pack generation

Transactions do not end at checkout.

4. Explicit Non-Goals

The following are explicit non-goals of this project.

These exclusions are deliberate and enforceable.

4.1 General-Purpose E-Commerce

The platform is not intended to:

Compete with consumer e-commerce platforms

Support unregulated consumer goods

Provide open seller marketplaces with minimal controls

4.2 Rapid MVP or Growth-First Design

The project explicitly rejects:

Feature-first development

“Ship now, govern later” approaches

Experimental production behaviour

Correctness and defensibility override speed.

4.3 Trust-Based Supplier Participation

The platform will not:

Allow suppliers to transact without verification

Rely on declarations without evidence

Permit manual overrides of compliance state

Trust is replaced by verifiable system controls.

4.4 Mutable or Negotiable Governance

The platform will not support:

Post-commitment pricing changes

Manual audit record edits

Undocumented exceptions

Informal rule bypasses

Governance is enforced, not negotiated.

4.5 UI-Driven Truth

The platform will not:

Allow frontend logic to override backend truth

Present marketing representations inconsistent with system state

Hide compliance, delivery, or pricing realities from buyers

UI reflects system truth only.

4.6 Externalised Document Control

The platform will not treat documents as:

Casual uploads

External storage references

Non-authoritative artefacts

Document control is first-class and internal.

5. Boundary of Responsibility

The platform is responsible for:

Enforcing system rules

Preserving evidence

Preventing invalid transactions

Producing regulator-ready outputs

The platform is not responsible for:

Supplier manufacturing quality beyond certification scope

Buyer installation practices

External regulatory interpretation beyond codified rules

Third-party logistics provider operational failures (beyond tracking and escalation)

Responsibilities are enforced at system boundaries.

6. Scope Control and Change Management

Any proposal to:

Add new functional domains

Relax governance constraints

Introduce new transaction models

Alter Core responsibilities

is considered out of scope by default and requires:

Formal change request

Impact analysis

Risk assessment

Approval under the Change Control Framework

No exceptions.

7. Dependency and Authority

This document constrains:

Architectural decisions

Extension eligibility

Feature proposals

Commercial models

Integration strategies

Any artefact or system behaviour outside these boundaries is invalid unless this document is formally revised.

8. Approval and Locking

Upon approval, this document shall be:

Marked APPROVED

Version-locked

Governed under formal change control

Treated as a permanent constraint on the project
