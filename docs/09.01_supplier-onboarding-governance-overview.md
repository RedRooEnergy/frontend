09.01 — Supplier Onboarding & Verification Governance (Overview)
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance framework, scope, and non-negotiable rules for the Supplier Onboarding & Verification Extension. It establishes how suppliers are admitted, verified, monitored, and—if required—revoked, under Immutable Core enforcement.

Supplier onboarding is a regulated gateway, not a registration flow.

2. Governance Doctrine

No supplier may transact unless their identity, legality, and compliance state are verified and current.

Supplier onboarding must:

• Enforce identity and legal verification
• Require documented compliance evidence
• Operate through explicit approval states
• Produce immutable audit records
• Be revocable without data loss

No bypass, provisional access, or “soft approval” is permitted.

3. Scope of This Extension

This extension governs:

• Supplier identity intake
• Legal entity validation
• Certification submission and validation
• Approval and revocation workflows
• Supplier-facing governed dashboard
• Continuous compliance monitoring

Out of scope:

• Buyer interactions
• Payments
• Product publication (covered in Phase 10)

4. Relationship to the Immutable Core

This extension:

• Depends on Core identity, RBAC, audit logging, and governance hooks
• Cannot override Core enforcement
• Operates entirely within Core authorization and change-control constraints

All state transitions are validated by 08.05 Governance Enforcement Hooks.

5. Supplier Definition

A Supplier is a legal entity that:

• Manufactures, distributes, or supplies regulated goods
• Enters into governed contractual relationships
• Submits compliance documentation
• Accepts ongoing monitoring and audit

Suppliers are not users. Users act on behalf of suppliers.

6. Supplier Onboarding States (High-Level)

Canonical states:

• Draft
• Submitted
• Under Review
• Approved
• Restricted
• Revoked

State transitions are explicit, audited, and governed.

No implicit transitions are permitted.

7. Verification Domains

Supplier verification includes, at minimum:

• Identity & legal existence
• Corporate authority & signatories
• Regulatory certifications
• Jurisdictional eligibility
• Ongoing validity monitoring

Each domain must have documented evidence requirements.

8. Documentation Doctrine

All supplier submissions:

• Are stored as governed documents
• Are versioned and immutable once accepted
• Are hash-verified
• Are retained per data-retention doctrine

Documents are treated as legal artefacts, not uploads.

9. Approval Authority

Supplier approval authority:

• Is role-restricted
• Requires explicit justification
• Is auditable
• Cannot be delegated implicitly

Automated approvals are prohibited unless explicitly governed.

10. Revocation & Restriction

The system must support:

• Temporary restriction (partial capability removal)
• Full revocation (transaction prohibition)
• Immediate enforcement across all extensions

Revocation does not delete historical data.

11. Audit & Evidence

Every onboarding action must produce:

• Actor identity
• Action taken
• Previous and resulting state
• Governing artefact references
• Timestamp

Audit records are immutable and exportable.

12. Security & Abuse Controls

The extension must detect:

• Fraudulent submissions
• Repeated rejection patterns
• Document tampering attempts
• Circumvention behaviour

Findings must escalate per incident governance.

13. Non-Functional Guarantees

Supplier onboarding prioritises:

• Governance over speed
• Accuracy over convenience
• Auditability over UX simplicity
