11.01 — DDP Freight & Customs Governance Framework
1. Purpose

This document establishes the authoritative governance framework for Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) freight and customs handling within the marketplace. Freight and customs are treated as regulated financial and compliance systems, not auxiliary services.

All logistics flows must be deterministic, auditable, and immune to manual override.

2. Governance Doctrine

If the system cannot prove landed cost, the transaction must not proceed.

This framework enforces:

• Full landed-cost determinism before payment
• Supplier accountability for duties and taxes
• Buyer price certainty at checkout
• Regulator-ready customs and tax evidence
• Zero post-purchase cost surprises

DDP is mandatory. No alternative incoterms are permitted.

3. Scope

This framework governs:

• Freight calculation logic
• Customs duty and tax handling
• HS code governance
• Carrier integrations
• Shipment state tracking
• Evidence generation

Out of scope:

• Payment execution (Phase 12)
• Buyer UX (Phase 13)
• Commercial margin rules (Phase 6)

4. Mandatory DDP Enforcement

All shipments must satisfy:

• Supplier bears all duties, GST/VAT, customs charges
• Buyer pays a single, final landed price
• No cash-on-delivery, no destination billing

Orders that cannot be priced DDP are blocked.

5. Freight System as a Governed Subsystem

The freight system is:

• Deterministic
• Versioned
• Auditable
• Non-interactive

Freight outcomes are computed, not negotiated.

6. Freight Eligibility Preconditions

Freight calculation may occur only if:

• Product is published and compliant
• HS code is assigned and validated
• Country-of-origin is known
• Destination jurisdiction is supported
• Dimensional data is complete

Missing data results in hard failure.

7. HS Code Governance

Each product must have:

• A single authoritative HS code
• Jurisdictional validation rules
• Audit history of changes

HS codes may only be assigned or amended under governance control.

8. Duty & Tax Calculation Authority

Duties and taxes are calculated using:

• HS classification
• Country of origin
• Destination jurisdiction
• Declared customs value
• Applicable trade agreements

Manual duty entry is prohibited.

9. Currency Normalisation

Freight and customs calculations must:

• Normalise all values to the system base currency
• Record original currency sources
• Capture exchange rates with timestamps

Currency drift after checkout is not permitted.

10. Freight Cost Components

Each DDP calculation must itemise:

• Base freight charge
• Fuel surcharges
• Insurance
• Customs duty
• GST/VAT
• Brokerage and clearance fees

Itemisation is stored even if not shown to buyers.

11. Carrier Integration Rules

Carrier integrations must:

• Operate asynchronously
• Enforce hard timeouts
• Fail closed
• Never block checkout indefinitely

Carrier responses are advisory inputs, not authoritative truth.

12. Shipment Creation Authority

Shipments may be created only:

• After payment authorisation
• Using locked pricing snapshots
• With immutable shipment records

Shipment creation prior to payment is prohibited.

13. Shipment State Model

Shipment states are governed and immutable once transitioned:

• Pending
• Booked
• In Transit
• Cleared
• Delivered
• Exception

Manual state mutation is prohibited.

14. Exception Handling

Exceptions include:

• Carrier failure
• Customs inspection
• Documentation mismatch
• Regulatory holds

All exceptions generate:

• Audit events
• Buyer notifications (informational only)
• Admin oversight records

15. Evidence & Documentation

For each shipment, the system must retain:

• Commercial invoice
• Packing list
• HS classification evidence
• Duty and tax calculation record
• Carrier tracking references

Documents are immutable and retained per policy.

16. Audit & Regulator Readiness

The freight system must support:

• Order-level landed cost reconstruction
• Customs declaration verification
• Duty and tax audit trails
• Regulator export packages

All exports must be reproducible from source records.

17. Failure Doctrine

Freight system failures must:

• Block checkout
• Preserve prior valid pricing
• Emit structured audit logs
• Never default to zero or estimated costs

Silent fallback is prohibited.

18. Extension Interaction Rules

Other extensions may:

• Consume freight outputs
• Display shipment states

Extensions may not:

• Alter freight logic
• Bypass HS or duty checks
• Inject shipment records
