6.03 — Investor & Board Reporting Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance framework for Investor and Board-level reporting. These reports provide strategic visibility into platform performance, risk posture, and governance health without compromising audit integrity or operational controls.

Investor and Board reports are derived views, not primary records.

2. Governing Principle

Visibility without mutability.

Investor and Board reporting must reflect authoritative system truth while remaining strictly non-operational and non-interventional.

3. Scope

This governance applies to reports prepared for:

• Board of Directors
• Investors and shareholders
• Lenders and strategic partners
• Insurers (non-forensic context)

It does not apply to regulator or audit evidence, which is governed separately.

4. Authoritative Data Sources

All reports must be generated exclusively from:

• Immutable system records
• Audit-verified aggregates
• Locked financial snapshots
• Compliance state summaries

Manual spreadsheets or external calculations are prohibited.

5. Report Classification

Permitted report classes:

• Governance & Compliance Overview
• Financial Performance Summary
• Risk & Incident Summary
• Operational Health Metrics
• Strategic KPIs

Each report must declare its class explicitly.

6. Separation from Audit Evidence

Investor and Board reports:

• Are not Evidence Packs
• Do not replace audit artefacts
• Must reference, not replicate, forensic data

Any forensic request must trigger Phase 16.02.

7. Aggregation Rules

Reports may include:

• Aggregated counts
• Trend analysis
• Time-series summaries

Reports may not include:

• Raw transaction data
• Personally identifiable information
• Editable source artefacts

8. Immutability & Versioning

Each report must include:

• Report ID
• Reporting period
• Data cut-off timestamp
• Generator version

Once issued, reports are immutable and versioned.

9. Disclosure Controls

Reports must comply with:

• Confidentiality classifications
• Insider information rules
• Jurisdictional disclosure laws

Audience scope must be explicitly declared.

10. Risk & Compliance Signalling

Reports must clearly signal:

• Open compliance risks
• Active investigations
• Material incidents
• Regulatory exposure

Silence or omission is prohibited.

11. Financial Reporting Alignment

Financial figures must align with:

• Locked pricing snapshots
• Escrow settlement states
• Recognised revenue rules

Pro-forma or speculative figures must be clearly labelled.

12. KPI Governance

KPIs must be:

• Defined centrally
• Calculated consistently
• Auditable in derivation

Ad-hoc KPIs are prohibited.

13. Visualisation Controls

Charts and visual summaries:

• Must be derived directly from governed datasets
• Must not obscure material risk
• Must include data scope notes

Visual polish must not distort substance.

14. Approval Workflow

Before release, reports must be:

• Reviewed by governance authority
• Approved by designated signatory
• Logged in the DMS

Unapproved circulation is prohibited.

15. Distribution Controls

Reports may be distributed only via:

• Secure portals
• Controlled document delivery systems

Email distribution must be access-controlled and logged.

16. Retention Rules

Investor and Board reports are subject to:

• Fixed retention schedules
• Version preservation
• Legal hold where applicable

Deletion requires formal approval.

17. Conflict Resolution

If discrepancies arise between:

• Investor reports
• Audit evidence
• Regulatory disclosures

The authoritative source is always the immutable system record.

18. Misuse Prohibition

Reports must not be used to:

• Override governance decisions
• Justify operational shortcuts
• Bypass audit processes

They are informational only.
