01.08 — Assumptions, Constraints & Non-Negotiables

Project Name: RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace
Document Type: Foundational Governance Artefact
Phase: Phase 1 — Master Project Definition
Status: DRAFT (to be approved and locked)
Change Control: Not active (pre-baseline)

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the assumptions, constraints, and non-negotiable principles that govern the RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace.

These elements:

Exist independently of implementation choices

Override convenience, optimisation, and speed

Cannot be altered without formal change control once locked

They represent the operating reality of the platform.

2. Foundational Assumptions

The platform is designed and built under the following assumptions. If any assumption is later proven false, the platform must be reassessed before modification.

2.1 Regulatory Environment

It is assumed that:

The marketplace operates in regulated energy, electrical, and import/export environments

Regulatory scrutiny is expected, not exceptional

Evidence retention, auditability, and traceability are mandatory

The platform is designed on the basis that regulators, insurers, and auditors will review system behaviour.

2.2 Multi-Party Accountability

It is assumed that:

Multiple legal entities participate (buyers, suppliers, service partners, operator)

Liability is distributed and must be provable

System records may be used in disputes, claims, or proceedings

System records must therefore be defensible.

2.3 Long-Lived Transactions

It is assumed that:

Transactions may span weeks or months

Compliance states may change mid-lifecycle

Orders, payments, and logistics are not instantaneous

The system must preserve state history across time.

2.4 Adversarial Conditions Are Normal

It is assumed that:

Errors will occur

Disputes will arise

Parties may act in self-interest

External systems may fail

The platform is built to withstand stress, not to assume goodwill.

3. Structural Constraints

The following constraints are absolute and define how the system must be built and operated.

3.1 Governance-First Architecture

The platform is constrained to a governance-first architecture, meaning:

Governance artefacts precede implementation

No feature exists without a governing document

Code must reflect governance, not invent it

UI-first or feature-led development is prohibited.

3.2 Immutable Core + Versioned Extensions

The architecture is constrained to:

A frozen, immutable Core

Independently versioned Extensions

No cross-contamination between Core and Extensions

The Core may only change via formal change control.

3.3 Audit-Grade Data Handling

All data handling is constrained by:

Immutability for committed records

Hashing for integrity verification

Full audit trails for state changes

Silent mutation is prohibited.

3.4 Separation of Concerns by Hosting Model

The platform is constrained to:

Stateless frontend hosting

Controlled, stateful backend services

Databases that support auditability

Operational convenience must not override this separation.

3.5 Role-Based Authority Enforcement

All actions are constrained by:

Explicit role definitions

Permission checks at the backend

No implicit trust in client input

Administrative power is limited by design.

4. Non-Negotiables

The following principles are non-negotiable. They are not preferences and cannot be waived.

4.1 No Ungoverned State Changes

There shall be:

No undocumented changes

No “temporary” overrides

No manual fixes without traceability

Every change must be attributable and reviewable.

4.2 No Bypass Paths

There shall be:

No alternate checkout flows

No admin shortcuts that bypass rules

No emergency paths without logging

If a rule exists, it applies universally.

4.3 No Feature Without Evidence

There shall be:

No feature added without governance documentation

No deployment without test evidence

No release without approval records

Documentation is part of the feature.

4.4 No Trust in External Systems

External services:

Are assumed to fail

Must be time-bounded

Must not block system integrity

The platform remains authoritative.

4.5 No Loss of Evidence

There shall be:

No deletion of authoritative records

No overwriting of committed artefacts

No reliance on informal communication

Evidence preservation is mandatory.

5. Operational Constraints

The platform is constrained to operate under the following conditions:

Must be supportable by a small, disciplined team

Must tolerate partial outages

Must degrade safely

Must remain inspectable under failure

Operational resilience outweighs speed.

6. Implications for Design and Build

These assumptions and constraints imply that:

Some features will be slower to implement

Some UX patterns will be deliberately conservative

Some automation will replace flexibility

These are accepted trade-offs.

7. Validation and Locking

Upon approval, this document shall be:

Marked APPROVED

Version-locked

Referenced in all architecture and build decisions

Used to reject conflicting proposals

Any breach requires formal change control.
