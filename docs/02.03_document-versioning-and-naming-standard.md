02.03 — Document Versioning & Naming Convention Standard
1. Purpose

This document establishes the mandatory versioning and naming conventions for all documents within the Authoritative Document Management System (DMS).

Its objective is to ensure:

• Unambiguous document identification
• Audit-grade traceability
• Immutable historical records
• Predictable lifecycle management
• Regulator- and court-safe referencing

No document may exist, be referenced, or be relied upon unless it conforms to this standard.

2. Governing Principles

The document control system is governed by the following principles:

• Documents are legal and operational artefacts, not files
• A document’s identity is permanent
• Versions evolve; identities do not
• Superseded documents remain accessible
• No document is silently replaced
• Naming must survive system migration, export, and litigation

Accordingly, file names are authoritative identifiers, not cosmetic labels.

3. Mandatory Document Identity Components

Every document must contain the following components:

Category Number

Document Sequence Number

Short Descriptive Title

Version Identifier

File Extension

These components must appear in this order.

4. Standard Filename Format

The canonical filename format is:

<category>.<sequence>_<short-title>_v<major>.<minor>.<status>.<ext>

5. Component Definitions
5.1 Category Number

• Two-digit number matching the authoritative DMS category
• Must correspond exactly to the category folder

Example:

02

5.2 Document Sequence Number

• Two-digit number unique within the category
• Assigned sequentially
• Never reused, even if a document is withdrawn

Example:

03

5.3 Short Descriptive Title

• Lowercase
• Hyphen-separated
• No spaces, special characters, or punctuation
• Must describe the document’s function, not its status

Example:

document-versioning-and-naming-standard

5.4 Version Identifier

Versioning follows semantic document versioning:

v<major>.<minor>.<status>


Where:

• Major — structural or policy-breaking change
• Minor — additive or clarifying change
• Status — lifecycle state (see below)

5.5 Status Codes (Mandatory)

Only the following status codes are permitted:

• DRAFT — In preparation, not approved
• APPROVED — Formally approved but not yet locked
• LOCKED — Immutable baseline, change control required
• SUPERSEDED — Replaced by a newer document
• RETIRED — No longer applicable but retained for record

Example:

v1.0.DRAFT

7. Version Increment Rules
7.1 Minor Version Increment

Increment minor when:

• Clarifying language
• Adding non-breaking sections
• Correcting errors without policy impact

Example:

v1.1 → v1.2

7.2 Major Version Increment

Increment major when:

• Governance rules change
• Responsibilities shift
• Enforcement logic changes
• Backward compatibility is broken

Example:

v1.9 → v2.0

8. Status Transition Rules

Permitted transitions:

DRAFT → APPROVED → LOCKED
LOCKED → SUPERSEDED
LOCKED → RETIRED


Prohibited transitions:

• LOCKED → DRAFT
• APPROVED → DRAFT
• SUPERSEDED → ACTIVE

9. Folder Naming Alignment

Folder names must mirror category numbers only.

Example:

02_document-control-governance/


Folder names must not contain version numbers or document titles.

10. Referencing Rules

When referencing documents:

• Always reference category.sequence + title + version
• Never reference “latest” or “current”
• References must remain valid after supersession

Correct:

See 02.03_document-versioning-and-naming-standard_v1.0.LOCKED


Incorrect:

See the latest naming rules

11. Enforcement

The following are explicit violations:

• Files without version identifiers
• Overwriting an existing version
• Renaming a document without version increment
• Storing drafts outside the DMS
• Using timestamps instead of semantic versions

Violations constitute a document control breach.

12. Change Control

Any modification to this standard requires:

• Formal change request
• Impact assessment across all categories
• Approval under Change Control Governance

13. Status

Status: DRAFT
Becomes immutable when approved and locked under Phase 2
