14.03 — Returns & Refunds Execution Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance rules for executing approved returns and refunds after a buyer action has been validated and authorised.

Its purpose is to ensure that execution is deterministic, auditable, escrow-safe, and incapable of bypassing financial or compliance controls.

Execution is distinct from request and approval.

2. Governing Principle

Approval authorises execution.
Governance controls execution.

No refund or return execution may occur unless explicitly authorised by a governed case outcome.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Physical product returns
• Refund execution (full and partial)
• Replacement dispatch authorisation
• Escrow release or clawback
• Settlement adjustments

Out of scope:

• Buyer request submission
• Supplier remediation outside the platform

4. Preconditions for Execution

Execution may occur only if:

• A governed case outcome exists
• Refund or return type is classified
• Escrow and settlement state permits execution
• Required evidence is complete
• Authorised amounts are defined

Missing preconditions block execution.

5. Execution Authority Model

Execution authority is determined by:

• Case outcome classification
• Financial exposure thresholds
• Compliance implications

Execution authority is role-bound and auditable.

6. Return Execution Rules

For physical returns:

• An RMA reference must exist
• Return logistics must be governed
• Receipt confirmation is required
• Condition verification may be required

Return receipt does not guarantee refund.

7. Refund Execution Rules

Refund execution must:

• Reference original pricing snapshot
• Respect authorised refund amounts
• Use correct refund source hierarchy
• Generate provider-confirmed records

Refunds exceeding authorisation are blocked.

8. Partial Refund Handling

Partial refunds must:

• Allocate amounts deterministically
• Maintain snapshot consistency
• Preserve rounding rules

Partial execution must not distort ledger integrity.

9. Replacement Authorisation

Where replacements are authorised:

• Replacement scope must be defined
• Pricing snapshot reference is required
• No new commercial negotiation occurs

Replacements do not alter original order truth.

10. Escrow Interaction

Execution must:

• Adjust escrow balances correctly
• Prevent premature fund release
• Trigger reconciliation workflows

Escrow is authoritative over timing.

11. Settlement Adjustments

If settlement has occurred:

• Supplier clawback rules apply
• Ledger corrections are append-only
• Provider confirmations are required

Settlement reversal is governed, not assumed.

12. Provider Execution Verification

All execution actions must be verified by:

• Provider confirmation
• Amount and currency validation
• Snapshot hash reference

Provider success alone is insufficient.

13. Failure Handling

If execution fails:

• Funds remain locked
• Execution state is frozen
• Incident workflow is triggered

Retries are governed and logged.

14. Buyer & Supplier Notifications

Execution completion may trigger notifications only if:

• Execution is fully confirmed
• Reconciliation passes
• Notification governance permits

Notifications must reflect final outcomes only.

15. Audit & Evidence

Each execution must generate:

• Execution event record
• Financial deltas
• Provider confirmations
• Escrow and ledger linkage

Execution evidence is regulator-ready.

16. Abuse & Fraud Prevention

The system must prevent:

• Duplicate execution
• Over-refunding
• Unauthorised execution
• Provider-only execution triggers

Governance enforcement is mandatory.

17. Change Control

Any change affecting:

• Execution logic
• Escrow interaction
• Provider handling

Requires formal governance approval.

18. Enforcement Status

This governance is:

• Mandatory
• Runtime-enforced
• Non-bypassable

Manual shortcuts are prohibited.
