02.05 — Read-Only Baseline Enforcement Policy
1. Purpose

This policy defines the mandatory rules and enforcement mechanisms governing when documents become read-only baselines and how those baselines are protected against alteration, deletion, or silent replacement.

Its objective is to ensure:

• Immutable governance artefacts
• Audit-safe baselines
• Regulator-defensible records
• Controlled evolution through formal change control
• Zero ambiguity over what rules were in force at any point in time

Once a document is locked, it becomes part of the authoritative system baseline.

2. Governing Principles

Baseline enforcement is governed by the following principles:

• Governance is meaningless without immutability
• Baselines exist to prevent retrospective alteration
• Locked documents represent institutional truth
• Convenience never overrides traceability
• Change is permitted only through formal processes

Accordingly, read-only enforcement is mandatory, not advisory.

3. Definition of a Baseline

A baseline is a document version that:

• Has completed the approval workflow
• Is marked with status LOCKED
• Is relied upon by downstream artefacts, code, or operations
• Represents the authoritative rule set in force

Baselines may exist at multiple levels (project, phase, system), but all share identical immutability rules.

4. Trigger Conditions for Baseline Lock

A document must be locked when any of the following occur:

• It governs subsequent documents or build phases
• It defines enforcement logic or constraints
• It is referenced by code, CI/CD rules, or contracts
• It is required for regulatory or audit readiness
• The project formally progresses beyond the document’s phase

Failure to lock when required constitutes a governance breach.

5. Enforcement Mechanisms

Baseline enforcement must be applied through multiple, overlapping controls.

5.1 File System Controls

• LOCKED documents must be set to read-only at the file level
• Write permissions must be removed for non-authorised roles
• Deletion must be prevented by default

5.2 Repository Controls

• LOCKED documents must reside in protected branches
• Branch protection rules must prevent direct edits
• All changes require pull requests with approvals
• Commit history must remain intact

5.3 Process Controls

• Any proposed change requires a formal change request
• Impact assessment must precede modification
• Replacement documents must be versioned and approved
• Supersession must be explicit

6. Prohibited Actions

The following actions are explicitly prohibited once a document is LOCKED:

• Editing content
• Renaming the file
• Changing version identifiers
• Deleting the document
• Replacing the file without version increment
• Moving the document to another category

These actions constitute a baseline integrity violation.

7. Permitted Actions on Locked Documents

The following actions are permitted:

• Read and reference
• Link from other documents
• Audit and review
• Supersede via formal process

No direct modification is permitted under any circumstance.

8. Supersession vs Modification

A LOCKED document may never be modified.

Instead:

• A new document version must be created
• The new version must follow full lifecycle approval
• The original document must be marked SUPERSEDED
• Referential continuity must be preserved

This ensures historical accuracy and legal defensibility.

9. Baseline Scope

Baselines apply to:

• Governance documents
• Legal artefacts
• Compliance matrices
• Commercial rulebooks
• Data model specifications
• Audit and evidence policies

No category is exempt.

10. Breach Handling

Any breach of baseline enforcement must trigger:

• Immediate incident record
• Identification of affected artefacts
• Assessment of downstream impact
• Corrective actions
• Audit trail entry

Repeated breaches constitute systemic governance failure.

11. Change Control

This policy itself may only be modified through:

• Formal change request
• Impact analysis across all categories
• Approval by governing authority

12. Status
