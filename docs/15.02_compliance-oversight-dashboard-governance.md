15.02 — Compliance Oversight Dashboard Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance rules for the Compliance Oversight Dashboard, whose sole function is to provide authoritative visibility into compliance states, evidence, and regulatory mappings across suppliers, products, orders, and shipments.

This dashboard exists to observe and evidence compliance, not to modify it.

2. Governing Principle

Compliance is enforced by systems.
Oversight confirms, evidences, and escalates.

No human interface may weaken or bypass compliance controls.

3. Scope

Applies to dashboards used by:

• Compliance Officers
• Regulatory Liaisons
• Risk Officers (read-only)
• Auditors (read-only)

Covers visibility into:

• Supplier compliance
• Product certification
• Order-level compliance
• Shipment and customs compliance

4. Role-Based Access

Defined roles and permissions:

• Compliance Officer — full oversight, escalation initiation
• Risk Officer — read-only visibility
• Auditor — read-only, export-enabled
• Admin — role-limited visibility only

Role escalation requires change control.

5. Read-Only Enforcement

The Compliance Oversight Dashboard is read-only by default.

It must not permit:

• Manual approval
• Manual revocation
• Status overrides
• Document replacement

All state changes occur through governed workflows.

6. Compliance Domains Displayed

The dashboard must surface compliance across domains:

• Supplier identity and legal status
• Certifications and expiry
• Product-level compliance artefacts
• Regulatory mappings
• Jurisdictional applicability

Each domain is independently evidenced.

7. Evidence-Centric Design

Every compliance indicator must link to:

• Source documents
• Submission metadata
• Validation outcomes
• Hash values
• Timestamped audit events

No “green tick” without traceable evidence.

8. Temporal Accuracy

Compliance data must display:

• Effective date
• Expiry date
• Validation timestamp
• Jurisdictional time reference

Historical states must remain viewable.

9. Certification Lifecycle Visibility

The dashboard must show:

• Initial submission
• Validation outcome
• Renewal events
• Expiry warnings
• Revocation history

Lifecycle events are immutable.

10. Regulatory Mapping View

Each compliance artefact must be mapped to:

• Specific regulation or standard
• Clause or section reference
• Enforcement requirement

This mapping must be visible and exportable.

11. Cross-Linking Rules

Compliance dashboards must link to:

• Supplier profiles
• Product records
• Orders and shipments
• Audit logs

Navigation must not permit editing.

12. Alerts & Thresholds

The dashboard may display alerts for:

• Expiring certifications
• Invalid documentation
• Regulatory changes
• Non-compliant orders

Alerts are informational, not corrective actions.

13. Escalation Triggers

Permitted actions:

• Initiate compliance escalation
• Flag regulatory concern
• Request formal review

Each trigger must record:

• Initiator
• Reason
• Timestamp

Escalation does not modify state.

14. Export & Regulator Views

The dashboard must support:

• Regulator-ready exports
• Evidence packs
• Certification summaries

Exports must be reproducible and hash-verifiable.

15. Audit Logging

All interactions must log:

• Viewer identity
• Role
• Artefacts accessed
• Timestamp

Viewing sensitive compliance data is auditable.

16. Security Controls

The dashboard must enforce:

• Strong authentication
• Role verification
• Session expiry
• Access logging

Any unauthorised access is a security incident.

17. Failure Behaviour

On system failure:

• Dashboard must fail closed
• No partial compliance states shown
• No stale data presented

Compliance truth must remain authoritative.

18. Change Control

Changes affecting:

• Compliance visibility
• Regulatory mappings
• Export formats

Require formal change control approval.

19. Non-Bypass Rule

The Compliance Oversight Dashboard:

• Cannot approve suppliers
• Cannot approve products
• Cannot release funds
• Cannot override enforcement

Oversight is not execution.
