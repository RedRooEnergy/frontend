08.01 — Immutable Core Platform Specification
1. Purpose

This document defines the Immutable Core Platform: the minimal, permanent foundation of the marketplace that cannot change without formal change control. The Core enforces governance, integrity, auditability, and trust. All functional capability is delivered through independently versioned Extensions.

The Core exists to guarantee:
• Identity integrity
• Role enforcement
• Record immutability
• Audit truth
• Deterministic outcomes

2. Core Doctrine

The Core never evolves by iteration. It evolves by exception.

Once locked, the Core:
• Is stable across time
• Is regulator-defensible
• Acts as the system of record

All innovation occurs outside the Core.

3. Core vs Extensions Boundary

Immutable Core includes only:
• Identity & authentication
• Role & authority enforcement
• Document immutability
• Versioning & lineage
• Audit logging & hashing
• Change control enforcement
• Evidence preservation hooks

Explicitly excluded from Core:
• UI/UX
• Business workflows
• Commercial logic
• Supplier features
• Buyer journeys
• Dashboards
• Integrations

Those belong to Extensions.

4. Mandatory Core Capabilities

The Core must provide, at minimum:

Identity Engine
• Unique actor identity
• Immutable actor IDs
• Credential lifecycle tracking

Role & Authority Engine
• Role definitions
• Permission matrices
• Non-bypassable enforcement

Record Immutability Engine
• Locking mechanism
• Mutation prevention
• State enforcement

Versioning Engine
• Version creation
• Lineage tracking
• Supersession handling

Audit Engine
• Event capture
• Deterministic ordering
• Actor attribution

Hashing & Integrity Engine
• Deterministic hashing
• Hash chains
• Tamper detection

Change Control Gate
• Core modification blocking
• Approval enforcement
• Exception logging

5. Core Data Characteristics

All Core-managed data must be:

• Append-only
• Time-ordered
• Hash-addressable
• Lineage-preserving

Deletion is prohibited.

6. Core Record Types

The Core directly governs:

• Identity records
• Role assignments
• Governance documents
• Change control records
• Audit events
• Evidence manifests

Other records may reference the Core but are not owned by it.

7. State Enforcement

All Core records must support states:

• DRAFT
• LOCKED
• SUPERSEDED
• REVOKED
• ARCHIVED

State transitions are enforced by the Core, not UI.

8. Immutability Guarantees

Once a Core record is LOCKED:

• No modification is permitted
• No metadata edits are allowed
• No re-indexing changes meaning

Any violation attempt:
• Is blocked
• Is logged
• Is escalated

9. Hashing Strategy (Core-Level)

The Core must:

• Generate deterministic hashes
• Chain hashes where required
• Store hashes alongside records
• Preserve prior hashes

Hash verification must be callable independently.

10. Change Control Interaction

Any proposal to modify the Core requires:

• Formal change request
• Risk assessment
• Legal impact review
• Explicit approval

Without approval, Core changes are technically impossible.

11. Extension Interaction Rules

Extensions may:

• Read Core data
• Reference Core IDs
• Subscribe to Core events

Extensions may never:
• Modify Core records
• Override Core decisions
• Bypass Core enforcement

12. Deployment Constraints

The Core must be:

• Deployed first
• Independently testable
• Independently auditable

Extensions must fail safely if Core services are unavailable.

13. Security Alignment

The Core enforces:

• Least-privilege access
• Non-repudiation
• Separation of duties

No shared secrets with Extensions.

14. Regulator & Audit Readiness

The Core must support:

• Full audit export
• Deterministic replay
• Evidence reconstruction

All exports must be hash-verifiable.

15. Failure Handling

If the Core fails:

• No writes are permitted
• Extensions enter read-only mode
• Recovery is audited

Silent degradation is prohibited.

16. Non-Functional Guarantees

The Core prioritises:

• Correctness over speed
• Integrity over convenience
• Determinism over flexibility

17. Status

Status: DRAFT
Phase: 8 — Immutable Core Platform
Upstream Dependency: Phase 7
Downstream Dependency: 08.02 — Audit Logging & Event Model
