04.04 — Mandatory Certification Rules & Validation Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory certification regime enforced by the platform.

It specifies which certifications are required, how they are validated, how they are versioned, and how failure or revocation is handled. Certifications are treated as system-enforced compliance controls, not supplier declarations.

2. Governing Principle

No supplier, product, shipment, or payment may proceed unless all applicable mandatory certifications are:

• Present
• Valid
• Current
• Jurisdiction-correct
• System-verified

Manual overrides are prohibited.

3. Certification Classes

Mandatory certifications are grouped into the following immutable classes:

• Electrical & Energy Compliance
• Product Safety & Performance
• Import & Customs Compliance
• Environmental & Efficiency
• Data, Cyber & Software Integrity (where applicable)

Each class has independent validation rules.

4. Certification Authority Model

Each certification must be issued by:

• An approved issuing authority
• Recognised by the relevant regulator
• Verifiable via primary or secondary sources

Self-issued certificates are invalid by default.

5. Certification Scope

Certificates may apply at one or more levels:

• Supplier-level
• Product-model-level
• Batch or serial-level
• Shipment-level

Scope is immutable once assigned.

6. Validation Rules

Every certification must pass all of the following checks:

• File format and integrity validation
• Issuer authority validation
• Expiry and version validation
• Jurisdiction alignment
• Scope compatibility

Failure of any check results in automatic rejection.

7. System Enforcement Points

Certification enforcement occurs at:

• Supplier onboarding
• Product submission
• Catalogue publication
• Checkout eligibility
• Payment release

Failure at any enforcement point blocks progression.

8. Expiry & Renewal Handling

• Expired certificates immediately invalidate dependent entities
• Grace periods are not permitted unless regulator-mandated
• Renewals require full re-validation
• Historical certificates remain immutable for audit

9. Revocation & Suspension

Certification revocation triggers:

• Immediate product delisting
• Supplier compliance status downgrade
• Payment holds (if applicable)
• Incident logging and escalation

Revocation events are audit-classified incidents.

10. Evidence & Audit Requirements

Each certification must generate:

• Hash-locked document record
• Validation log with timestamp
• Issuer metadata snapshot
• Dependency linkage (supplier/product/order)

Evidence must be exportable for regulators and auditors.

11. Prohibited Actions

The following are explicitly prohibited:

• Manual certificate approval
• Backdating certificates
• Editing uploaded certificates
• Substituting certificates across scopes

Violations escalate under the incident framework.

12. Change Control

Changes to certification rules require:

• Regulatory change reference
• Legal approval
• Compliance impact analysis
• Version increment

No retroactive application.
