19.02 — Failure Scenarios & Recovery Testing Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative governance framework for failure scenario testing and recovery validation. It ensures that the platform can withstand, detect, recover from, and learn from adverse conditions without data loss, governance breach, or uncontrolled risk escalation.

Failure is treated as a designed-for condition, not an anomaly.

2. Governing Principle

A system is only production-ready if it can fail safely and recover deterministically.

Successful recovery is a governance requirement, not a best-effort outcome.

3. Scope

This governance applies to failure scenarios involving:

• Application crashes
• Infrastructure outages
• Database unavailability
• Payment provider failures
• Webhook delivery failures
• Third-party service degradation
• Configuration errors
• Partial data corruption attempts

It applies to pre-production and staging environments.

4. Failure Scenario Design

Failure scenarios must be:

• Explicitly defined
• Repeatable
• Isolated where possible
• Representative of real-world conditions

Unplanned or accidental failures are insufficient for validation.

5. Mandatory Failure Categories

The following failure categories must be tested:

• Authentication and identity service failure
• Core API unavailability
• Database connectivity loss
• Background job interruption
• Payment provider outage
• Freight and carrier API timeout
• Audit logging failure
• Configuration rollback failure

No critical subsystem may be exempt.

6. Controlled Failure Injection

Failure testing must use:

• Controlled shutdowns
• Fault injection tooling
• Simulated dependency outages

Uncontrolled chaos testing is prohibited at this stage.

7. Detection & Alert Validation

For each failure scenario, testing must confirm:

• Failure detection
• Alert generation
• Correct severity classification
• Escalation path activation

Undetected failures are treated as critical defects.

8. Recovery Objectives

Recovery testing must validate:

• Service restart behaviour
• Data consistency after recovery
• Idempotency of operations
• Resumption of background processes

Manual data repair is prohibited.

9. Recovery Time & Point Objectives

Each failure scenario must define:

• Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
• Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

Measured outcomes must be recorded.

10. State Consistency & Integrity

Post-recovery validation must confirm:

• No lost or duplicated transactions
• Pricing snapshot integrity
• Audit log continuity
• Compliance state correctness

Integrity failures invalidate recovery success.

11. Partial Failure Handling

The system must demonstrate correct behaviour during:

• Degraded mode operation
• Partial dependency availability
• Graceful feature degradation

Silent data corruption is prohibited.

12. Human Intervention Boundaries

Recovery procedures must clearly define:

• Automated recovery steps
• Manual intervention triggers
• Required approvals

Ad-hoc intervention is prohibited.

13. Evidence & Documentation

Failure and recovery testing must produce:

• Scenario definitions
• Execution logs
• Alert records
• Recovery validation results

These artefacts are audit-eligible.

14. Incident Simulation Linkage

Where appropriate, failure scenarios must:

• Simulate incident declaration
• Trigger incident governance workflows
• Validate escalation and reporting

Failure testing feeds incident preparedness.

15. Defect Classification

Issues discovered during recovery testing must be classified as:

• Critical (block production)
• Major (require remediation)
• Minor (tracked with approval)

Classification must be justified.

16. Approval & Sign-Off

Completion of failure and recovery testing requires:

• Governance review
• Formal sign-off
• Documentation of residual risk

Release without sign-off is prohibited.
