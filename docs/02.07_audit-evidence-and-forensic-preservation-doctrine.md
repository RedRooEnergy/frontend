02.07 — Audit, Evidence & Forensic Preservation Doctrine
1. Purpose

This doctrine defines the mandatory requirements for audit readiness, forensic preservation, and evidentiary defensibility across the entire platform.

Its objective is to ensure that, at any point in time, the platform can:

• Withstand regulatory audit
• Support forensic investigation
• Defend legal challenges
• Demonstrate historical truth
• Prove integrity of records and decisions

This doctrine assumes hostile scrutiny, not cooperative review.

2. Governing Assumptions

The platform is designed under the following assumptions:

• Auditors will distrust undocumented processes
• Regulators will request historical states
• Investigators will assume compromise
• Legal proceedings may occur years later
• Evidence may be challenged aggressively

Accordingly, forensic preservation is proactive, not reactive.

3. Scope of Audit & Forensic Coverage

This doctrine applies to all of the following artefact classes:

• Governance documents
• Legal and contractual records
• Supplier and compliance records
• Product and catalogue artefacts
• Pricing snapshots and payment records
• Freight, customs, and delivery records
• System logs and event streams
• CI/CD pipelines and deployment artefacts
• Incident and breach records
• CRM cases and communications

No system component is exempt.

4. Audit Readiness Requirements

The platform must be able to demonstrate:

• What rule was in force at a given time
• Who approved that rule
• What data existed at that time
• What actions were taken
• Why decisions were made
• Whether controls were enforced

All answers must be derived from immutable records, not testimony.

5. Forensic Preservation Rules
5.1 Non-Destructive Preservation

• Evidence must never be altered during investigation
• Copies must be forensically sound
• Originals remain immutable
• Analysis occurs on verified duplicates

5.2 Chain of Custody

Every evidence artefact must support a provable chain of custody including:

• Creation timestamp
• Originating system or actor
• Access history
• Hash verification records
• Supersession or archival events

Breaks in custody invalidate evidence.

6. Event Logging as Evidence

System logs are treated as primary evidence, not diagnostics.

Requirements:

• Logs must be append-only
• Logs must be timestamped with synchronised clocks
• Logs must be protected against deletion
• Log retention must meet regulatory minimums
• Log integrity must be verifiable

Selective logging is prohibited.

7. Audit Trails

Every critical system action must generate an audit trail, including:

• Identity changes
• Permission grants or revocations
• Document approvals and locks
• Pricing snapshot creation
• Payment initiation and settlement
• Compliance approvals and revocations
• Deployment events
• Incident handling

Audit trails must be immutable and queryable.

8. Historical Reconstruction Capability

The platform must support reconstruction of system state at a given point in time, including:

• Governing documents in force
• Pricing and commercial rules
• Supplier compliance state
• Product visibility
• Payment and escrow status

Reconstruction must be deterministic and reproducible.

9. Regulator & Auditor Access

When required, the platform must be able to provide:

• Time-bounded evidence packs
• Hash manifests
• Access logs
• Exported artefacts in non-proprietary formats
• Explanatory metadata

Access must be controlled, logged, and time-limited.

10. Breach & Incident Forensics

In the event of a breach or incident:

• Evidence preservation takes precedence over remediation
• System state must be captured before changes
• Logs must be frozen
• Evidence packs must be generated
• Regulatory notification rules apply

Failure to preserve evidence constitutes a secondary breach.

11. Prohibited Actions

The following are explicit violations:

• Log deletion or truncation
• Evidence alteration during audit
• Re-running processes to “clean” history
• Manual edits to audit trails
• Undocumented forensic actions

Violations invalidate audit credibility.

12. Governance Enforcement

This doctrine is enforced through:

• DMS controls
• Repository protections
• CI/CD enforcement
• Access controls
• Monitoring and alerting

Non-compliance triggers governance escalation.

13. Change Control

This doctrine may only be modified through:

• Formal change request
• Legal and compliance review
• Risk assessment
• Governing authority approval
