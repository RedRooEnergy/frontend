17.02 — Vulnerability Management & Dependency Controls
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative vulnerability management and dependency control governance for the platform. It establishes how software vulnerabilities are detected, assessed, prioritised, remediated, accepted, and audited across all components of the system.

Vulnerability management is a continuous operational obligation, not an ad-hoc response.

2. Governing Principle

Unobserved vulnerabilities are treated as active risk.

All dependencies and components must be continuously observable for known and emerging security issues.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Application dependencies (frontend and backend)
• Infrastructure tooling and images
• CI/CD tooling and actions
• Third-party SDKs and APIs
• Transitive and indirect dependencies

It applies across development, staging, and production environments.

4. Vulnerability Sources

The platform must monitor vulnerabilities from:

• Public CVE databases
• Vendor security advisories
• Dependency scanner feeds
• CI/CD security tooling outputs

Single-source dependency intelligence is prohibited.

5. Dependency Inventory

A complete, continuously updated dependency inventory must exist for:

• Application packages
• Container base images
• Build tools
• Runtime services

Untracked dependencies are prohibited.

6. Severity Classification

Vulnerabilities must be classified using an accepted standard (e.g. CVSS) and mapped into platform governance tiers:

• Critical
• High
• Medium
• Low
• Informational

Severity classification must be recorded and immutable.

7. Mandatory Remediation Thresholds

The following remediation rules are enforced:

• Critical — Immediate remediation required; builds blocked
• High — Remediation required within defined SLA
• Medium — Remediation scheduled and tracked
• Low — Logged and reviewed periodically

No production deployment may proceed with unresolved Critical vulnerabilities.

8. CI/CD Enforcement

CI/CD pipelines must:

• Scan dependencies on every build
• Fail builds exceeding severity thresholds
• Prevent merge or deploy on Critical findings
• Log scan results immutably

Manual overrides are prohibited without formal approval.

9. Dependency Version Control

All dependencies must be:

• Explicitly version-pinned
• Reviewed before upgrade
• Tested for regression risk

Floating or wildcard versions are prohibited.

10. Risk Acceptance & Overrides

Temporary vulnerability acceptance is permitted only when:

• Business impact is documented
• Mitigations are defined
• Expiry date is enforced
• Approval authority is recorded

Accepted risk must never be silent.

11. Override Documentation

All overrides must include:

• Vulnerability identifier
• Severity level
• Justification
• Compensating controls
• Review and expiry date

Overrides must be auditable and time-bound.

12. Third-Party Service Risk

Third-party services must be evaluated for:

• Security posture
• Incident history
• Data handling practices
• Patch responsiveness

High-risk vendors require enhanced monitoring.

13. Runtime Exposure Monitoring

Where possible, vulnerability detection must extend to:

• Running containers
• Deployed services
• Active endpoints

Build-time scanning alone is insufficient.

14. Incident Linkage

If a vulnerability is exploited or suspected:

• It must be linked to an incident record
• Impact scope must be assessed
• Regulator notification rules may apply

Vulnerability events may escalate into incidents.

15. Reporting & Metrics

Vulnerability management metrics must include:

• Open vulnerabilities by severity
• Mean time to remediation
• Override count and age
• Dependency upgrade cadence

Metrics must be reportable to governance bodies.

16. Audit & Evidence

All vulnerability activities must generate:

• Immutable logs
• Evidence of scans
• Evidence of remediation
• Evidence of approvals

These artefacts are audit-eligible.

17. Continuous Improvement

Vulnerability trends must inform:

• Dependency selection
• Architecture decisions
• Security control refinement

Repeated exposure indicates governance failure.
