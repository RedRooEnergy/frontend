13.03 — Buyer Checkout & Order Commitment Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance rules controlling buyer checkout, order commitment, and the legal-commercial moment of transaction formation.

Its purpose is to ensure that checkout is a governed commitment process, not a UI interaction, and that once an order is committed, all commercial, pricing, and compliance conditions are immutable.

2. Governing Principle

Checkout is a point of no ambiguity.
Commitment creates obligation.

The system, not the UI, determines when an order legally exists.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Checkout initiation
• Pricing calculation
• Compliance validation
• Order commitment
• Payment intent creation
• Buyer confirmations

Out of scope:

• Pre-browse price estimates
• Marketing landing pages

4. Preconditions for Checkout

A buyer may initiate checkout only if:

• Buyer identity is authenticated
• Buyer jurisdiction is known
• Product(s) are fully compliant
• Supplier(s) are approved
• Commercial rules permit sale

Failure of any precondition blocks checkout.

5. Pricing Snapshot Generation

At checkout initiation:

• A pricing snapshot is generated
• All pricing components are resolved
• Margin floors are enforced
• Freight, duties, and taxes are calculated

Snapshot generation precedes payment.

6. Snapshot Review & Buyer Acknowledgement

Before commitment, the buyer must be presented with:

• Final price breakdown
• Taxes, duties, and freight
• Supplier identities
• Key compliance disclosures

Buyer acknowledgement is mandatory.

7. Order Commitment Moment

An order is considered committed when all of the following occur:

• Buyer confirms checkout
• Pricing snapshot is locked
• Snapshot hash is generated
• Order record is created
• Payment intent is initialised

UI confirmation alone is insufficient.

8. Immutability After Commitment

After commitment:

• Pricing cannot change
• Discounts cannot be added or removed
• Product composition cannot change
• Compliance state is frozen for the order

All changes require governed exception workflows.

9. Multi-Supplier Order Handling

For multi-supplier orders:

• A single buyer commitment may create multiple supplier sub-orders
• Each sub-order references the same pricing snapshot
• Supplier scopes are isolated

Buyer experiences a unified order.

10. Payment Eligibility Validation

Before payment execution:

• Pricing snapshot verification must pass
• Payment provider eligibility must be confirmed
• Escrow eligibility must be confirmed

Payment attempts without validation are rejected.

11. Payment Intent Creation

Payment intent creation must:

• Reference pricing snapshot ID
• Reference snapshot hash
• Include no provider-side price logic

Intent metadata is audit-critical.

12. Buyer Confirmation Records

The system must record:

• Buyer confirmation timestamp
• Buyer IP / session context (as permitted by law)
• Snapshot ID and hash
• Order ID

Records are immutable.

13. Error Handling During Checkout

If errors occur:

• Commitment must fail atomically
• No partial orders may exist
• Buyer must see a neutral failure state

Retry logic must re-run governance checks.

14. Abandonment Handling

If checkout is abandoned:

• Pricing snapshot expires after defined TTL
• No payment intent remains active
• No order is created

Expired snapshots cannot be reused.

15. Legal Formation of Contract

The order contract is formed at:

• Successful order commitment
• Governed by platform terms
• Referencing immutable snapshot

UI messaging must reflect this truth.

16. Audit & Evidence

Checkout generates:

• Pricing snapshot record
• Order creation event
• Buyer acknowledgement record
• Payment intent reference

These form the core transaction evidence pack.

17. Security & Abuse Prevention

The system must prevent:

• Replay of checkout confirmations
• Snapshot reuse across orders
• Tampering with client-side price data

Server-side validation is authoritative.

18. Change Control

Any change affecting:

• Checkout flow
• Commitment logic
• Snapshot timing

Requires formal governance approval.

19. Enforcement Status

This governance is:

• Mandatory
• Runtime-enforced
• Non-bypassable

Feature flags do not apply.
