02.04 — Document Lifecycle & Approval Workflow Policy
1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory lifecycle states, approval workflow, and control gates governing every document within the Authoritative Document Management System (DMS).

Its purpose is to ensure:

• Formal accountability for every document
• Controlled evolution of governance artefacts
• Immutable, auditable baselines
• Clear authority boundaries
• Regulator- and court-defensible records

No document may influence system design, build, or operation unless it has passed through the lifecycle defined herein.

2. Governing Principles

The document lifecycle is governed by the following principles:

• Documents are system controls, not notes
• Authority must precede enforcement
• Approval is explicit, not implied
• Immutability is deliberate, not assumed
• Historical versions are preserved
• Silence is not consent

Accordingly, no informal workflows are permitted.

3. Authoritative Lifecycle States

Every document must exist in exactly one of the following lifecycle states at any time.

3.1 DRAFT

• Document is under active preparation
• Content may change freely
• No operational or design reliance permitted
• Not enforceable

Permitted actions:
• Edit
• Comment
• Internal review

Prohibited actions:
• Approval
• Enforcement
• Locking

3.2 APPROVED

• Content has been formally reviewed
• Authority has accepted responsibility
• Document is valid for use
• Changes require justification

Permitted actions:
• Reference
• Implementation
• Preparation for locking

Prohibited actions:
• Silent edits
• Structural changes without version increment

3.3 LOCKED

• Document is immutable
• Forms part of the authoritative baseline
• Enforced by governance gates
• Any change requires formal change control

Permitted actions:
• Reference
• Audit
• Supersession via formal process

Prohibited actions:
• Editing
• Renaming
• Deletion

3.4 SUPERSEDED

• Document has been replaced
• Retained for historical and legal reference
• No longer authoritative

Permitted actions:
• Audit
• Reference (historical)

Prohibited actions:
• Enforcement
• Re-activation

3.5 RETIRED

• Document no longer applies
• Retained for recordkeeping
• Not enforceable

Permitted actions:
• Audit
• Legal reference

4. Mandatory Lifecycle Progression

The only permitted lifecycle progression is:

DRAFT → APPROVED → LOCKED → SUPERSEDED / RETIRED


Reverse transitions are explicitly prohibited.

5. Approval Authority Model

Each document must have an explicit approving authority, defined as:

• Role title (not individual name)
• Scope of authority
• Decision boundary

Approval must be recorded via:

• Version status change
• Approval record (date + authority)
• Immutable audit entry

Verbal or implied approval is invalid.

6. Review & Approval Workflow
6.1 Drafting Phase

• Document created in DRAFT status
• Internal review and comments permitted
• No dependency allowed

6.2 Approval Phase

To move from DRAFT to APPROVED, the following must occur:

• Completeness review
• Consistency check against governing documents
• Dependency validation
• Formal approval decision

Approval must be explicit and recorded.

6.3 Locking Phase

To move from APPROVED to LOCKED:

• Confirmation that downstream dependencies exist
• Confirmation that enforcement mechanisms are in place
• Governance sign-off
• Baseline snapshot creation

Once locked, the document becomes immutable.

7. Supersession Rules

A document may be superseded only when:

• A replacement document exists
• Replacement has equal or higher authority
• Replacement is APPROVED or LOCKED
• Supersession is explicitly declared

Superseded documents must reference the replacing document.

8. Retention & Accessibility

• All lifecycle states remain accessible
• No document may be deleted
• Access may be restricted but not removed
• Retention rules override convenience

9. Enforcement

The following constitute governance breaches:

• Using DRAFT documents for implementation
• Editing LOCKED documents
• Approving without authority
• Skipping lifecycle stages
• Backdating approvals

Breaches must be recorded as incidents.

10. Change Control

This policy itself may only be modified through:

• Formal change request
• Impact analysis across all categories
• Approval by governing authority

11. Status

Status: DRAFT
Becomes immutable when approved and locked under Phase 2
