14.02 — Notifications System Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance rules for the notifications system, ensuring that all notifications are accurate, auditable, event-driven, and incapable of misrepresenting system state.

Notifications are evidence-bearing communications, not convenience messages.

2. Governing Principle

A notification must never say more than the system can prove.

Notifications reflect confirmed events only. They do not predict outcomes or promise timelines.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Buyer notifications
• Supplier notifications
• Admin notifications
• Email, in-app, and system alerts
• Transactional and compliance notifications

Out of scope:

• Marketing campaigns
• Promotional messaging not tied to orders

4. Authoritative Triggers

Notifications may only be triggered by:

• Verified system events
• Explicit state transitions
• Approved case outcomes

Manual notification triggering is prohibited.

5. Event Classification

Every notification must reference:

• Event type
• Event source system
• Related entity IDs (order, case, snapshot)
• Timestamp

Unclassified notifications are rejected.

6. Notification Eligibility Rules

A notification may be sent only if:

• The recipient is authorised
• The event is relevant to the recipient role
• The notification type is enabled by governance rules

Eligibility checks are mandatory.

7. Content Accuracy Requirements

Notification content must:

• Reflect confirmed system state
• Avoid speculative language
• Avoid time promises unless deterministic
• Reference authoritative identifiers

Human-readable phrasing must remain conservative.

8. Timing & Ordering Rules

Notifications must:

• Be sent after event confirmation
• Respect event ordering
• Avoid duplication

Out-of-order notifications are prohibited.

9. Channel Governance

Supported channels may include:

• In-app notifications
• Email
• System alerts

Each channel must:

• Preserve message integrity
• Log delivery attempts
• Support audit replay

10. Failure Handling

If notification delivery fails:

• The failure must be logged
• Retry logic must be controlled
• Message integrity must be preserved

Silent failure is prohibited.

11. Notification Immutability

Once generated:

• Notification records are immutable
• Content cannot be edited
• Retractions require corrective notifications

Corrections must reference original messages.

12. User Preferences & Legal Constraints

Notification delivery must respect:

• User preferences (where allowed)
• Jurisdictional communication laws
• Mandatory regulatory notifications

Legal obligations override user preferences.

13. Abuse & Spam Prevention

The system must prevent:

• Notification flooding
• Duplicate notifications
• Event replay abuse

Rate limiting and deduplication are mandatory.

14. Audit & Evidence

Each notification must generate:

• Notification record
• Triggering event reference
• Delivery status
• Timestamp

Notifications must be regulator-exportable.

15. Change Control

Any change affecting:

• Notification triggers
• Message templates
• Delivery channels

Requires formal governance approval.

16. Enforcement Status

This governance is:

• Mandatory
• Runtime-enforced
• Non-bypassable

Ad-hoc messaging is prohibited.
