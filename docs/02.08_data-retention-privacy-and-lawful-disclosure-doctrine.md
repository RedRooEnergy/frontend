02.08 — Data Retention, Privacy & Lawful Disclosure Doctrine
1. Purpose

This doctrine defines the mandatory rules governing data retention periods, privacy protections, access controls, and lawful disclosure obligations across the entire platform.

Its objective is to ensure that the platform:

• Retains data for as long as legally and operationally required
• Does not retain data longer than permitted
• Protects personal and commercial information
• Supports regulator, court, and law-enforcement requests
• Remains defensible under privacy and data-protection law

Data retention is treated as a legal control, not a storage decision.

2. Governing Principles

This doctrine is governed by the following principles:

• Retain what is required, nothing less
• Delete only when lawfully permitted
• Privacy and audit obligations must coexist
• Disclosure is controlled, not discretionary
• Evidence preservation overrides convenience
• Silence is not consent to disclose

Accordingly, data handling must be deliberate and provable.

3. Scope

This doctrine applies to all data generated, stored, or processed by the platform, including:

• Governance and policy documents
• Supplier and buyer records
• Personal data
• Commercial and pricing data
• Payment and tax records
• Compliance documentation
• Shipping and customs data
• System logs and audit trails
• Communications and notifications
• Evidence packs and forensic artefacts

No data class is exempt.

4. Data Classification

All data must be classified into one or more of the following categories:

• Personal Data — Identifiable information relating to individuals
• Commercial Data — Pricing, contracts, negotiations, invoices
• Regulatory Data — Compliance records, certifications, filings
• Operational Data — Orders, shipments, system events
• Audit & Evidence Data — Logs, snapshots, evidence packs

Classification determines retention, access, and disclosure rules.

5. Retention Rules
5.1 Minimum Retention

Data must be retained for no less than the maximum of:

• Applicable statutory retention periods
• Contractual obligations
• Regulatory requirements
• Audit and insurance requirements

Retention periods may vary by jurisdiction and data class.

5.2 Maximum Retention

Where privacy or data-protection law imposes maximum retention limits:

• Data must be anonymised or restricted when permitted
• Deletion must be deliberate and logged
• Evidence preservation obligations take precedence

Deletion is never automatic without governance approval.

6. Privacy Protection Requirements

The platform must enforce:

• Role-based access controls
• Least-privilege principles
• Purpose limitation
• Access logging
• Data minimisation in user interfaces

Privacy protections must not weaken audit or compliance integrity.

7. Lawful Disclosure Rules

Data may only be disclosed when one or more of the following apply:

• Statutory obligation
• Court order
• Regulator request
• Contractual obligation
• Explicit consent (where legally valid)

All disclosures must be:

• Logged
• Scoped
• Time-bounded
• Authorised

Informal or verbal requests are invalid.

8. Disclosure Process

Before any disclosure:

• Authority must be verified
• Scope must be limited to request
• Legal basis must be documented
• Evidence pack must be generated
• Disclosure event must be recorded

Post-disclosure review is mandatory.

9. Cross-Border Data Handling

Where data crosses jurisdictions:

• Jurisdictional law must be identified
• Conflicting obligations must be resolved conservatively
• Transfers must be documented
• Adequate safeguards must be applied

Cross-border disclosure without review is prohibited.

10. Deletion & Anonymisation

Deletion or anonymisation may occur only when:

• Retention period has expired
• No active legal, audit, or regulatory hold exists
• Governance approval has been granted

All deletion or anonymisation events must be logged permanently.

11. Breach & Incident Interaction

In the event of a breach:

• Retention rules remain in force
• Evidence preservation overrides deletion
• Disclosure obligations may be triggered
• Privacy notifications may be required

Improper deletion during incidents is a critical violation.

12. Enforcement

The following constitute doctrine violations:

• Unlogged data deletion
• Over-retention without justification
• Disclosure without authority
• Privacy controls bypass
• Informal data sharing

Violations trigger governance escalation.

13. Change Control

This doctrine may only be modified through:

• Formal change request
• Legal and privacy review
• Impact analysis
• Governing authority approval
