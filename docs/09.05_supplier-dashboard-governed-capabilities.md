09.05 — Supplier Dashboard (Governed Capabilities & Visibility)
1. Purpose

This document defines the governed Supplier Dashboard as a controlled interface that exposes only those capabilities and data permitted by the supplier’s current governance state. The dashboard is a reflection of system truth, not a control plane that can override governance.

2. Governance Doctrine

Visibility follows authority. Capability follows compliance. UI follows Core enforcement.

The Supplier Dashboard must:

• Enforce RBAC and supplier state at render time and action time
• Reflect real-time compliance and restriction states
• Prevent access to unauthorised data or actions
• Produce auditable events for all interactions

UI affordances must never imply permissions that the Core would deny.

3. Scope

This document governs:

• Supplier-facing dashboard access
• Capability visibility by supplier state
• Read/write permissions per feature
• Action gating and feedback semantics
• Audit and telemetry requirements

Out of scope:

• Product creation rules (Phase 10)
• Payments and settlement actions (Phase 12)
• Buyer-facing UX (Phase 13)

4. Access Control & Entry Conditions

Dashboard access requires:

• Authenticated user identity (Phase 8)
• Valid role assignment (RBAC)
• Association with a supplier entity
• Supplier state ≠ Revoked

Access checks occur server-side for every request.

5. Capability Matrix by Supplier State

Draft / Submitted
• Read-only onboarding status
• Document upload (identity/compliance only)
• No product, catalogue, or order access

Approved
• Full governed capabilities enabled
• Product submission (subject to Phase 10)
• Order visibility and fulfilment actions
• Compliance and document management

Restricted
• Read-only visibility of most sections
• Compliance remediation actions only
• Product submission disabled
• Payments and settlements disabled

Revoked
• Dashboard access denied
• Historical data retained but inaccessible to supplier users

6. Feature Gating Rules

Each dashboard feature must declare:

• Required supplier state(s)
• Required role(s)
• Required compliance conditions

Features render disabled or hidden when conditions are not met. Actions are still validated server-side.

7. Action Execution Semantics

For every dashboard action:

Resolve identity and role

Resolve supplier state

Evaluate governance hooks

Execute or deny action

Emit audit event

Client-side checks are advisory only.

8. Feedback & Error Handling

Denials must be:

• Explicit and descriptive (without leaking internals)
• Consistent with governance outcomes
• Logged as authorization or governance events

Silent failures or misleading UI states are prohibited.

9. Data Visibility Rules

Suppliers may only view:

• Their own supplier entity data
• Their own documents and certifications
• Their own products and orders

Cross-supplier visibility is prohibited under all conditions.

10. Document Management Integration

The dashboard must integrate with the DMS to allow:

• Upload of governed documents
• Viewing of document status and expiry
• Access to immutable historical versions

Deletion or modification of accepted documents is prohibited.

11. Compliance & Alerting

The dashboard must surface:

• Compliance warnings and expiries
• Restriction reasons and remediation steps
• Governance notices and system messages

Alerts are informational; enforcement remains Core-driven.

12. Audit & Telemetry

Every dashboard interaction must log:

• Identity and role
• Supplier context
• Action attempted
• Outcome (success/denial)
• Timestamp

Telemetry supports investigation and optimisation without weakening governance.

13. Extension Interaction Rules

The Supplier Dashboard:

• Consumes states from onboarding, compliance, product, and order extensions
• Does not own or mutate authoritative state directly

State changes occur only through governed workflows.

14. Security Considerations

The dashboard must prevent:

• Parameter tampering
• IDOR vulnerabilities
• Client-side state manipulation
• Privilege escalation via UI

Security failures escalate under incident governance.

15. Non-Functional Guarantees

The dashboard prioritises:

• Correctness over convenience
• Transparency over flexibility
• Enforcement over UX shortcuts
