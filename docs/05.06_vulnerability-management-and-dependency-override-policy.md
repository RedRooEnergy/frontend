05.06 — Vulnerability Management & Dependency Override Policy
1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory governance framework for identifying, assessing, remediating, and—only where strictly justified—temporarily overriding vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies and platform components.

The objective is to ensure continuous security posture without introducing uncontrolled technical or regulatory risk.

2. Scope

This policy applies to:

• Application dependencies (frontend and backend)
• Infrastructure and container images
• Build tools and CI/CD dependencies
• Third-party SDKs and APIs
• Transitive dependencies

All dependency layers are in scope.

3. Governance Principles

The platform enforces the following principles:

• Vulnerabilities are governance events
• Defaults favour remediation over override
• Overrides are exceptional, temporary, and auditable
• Risk ownership is mandatory
• Silent acceptance of risk is prohibited

4. Vulnerability Identification

Vulnerabilities must be identified via:

• Automated dependency scanners
• Static security analysis tools
• Vendor advisories
• Third-party disclosures
• Regulator or auditor findings

Detection timestamps must be recorded.

5. Vulnerability Classification

Each vulnerability must be classified using:

• Severity (Low / Medium / High / Critical)
• Exploitability
• Exposure surface
• Regulatory relevance

Critical vulnerabilities receive priority handling.

6. Remediation Requirements

The default response to a vulnerability is:

• Upgrade the dependency
• Patch the affected component
• Remove the dependency
• Replace the affected library

Remediation must occur within defined timeframes based on severity.

7. Dependency Upgrade Governance

All dependency upgrades must:

• Be explicitly declared
• Be version-pinned
• Pass security and regression testing
• Be reviewed before merge

Automated upgrades without review are prohibited.

8. Override Doctrine (Exception Handling)

A dependency override is permitted only when:

• No patched version is available
• Immediate remediation would cause greater system or regulatory risk
• Temporary mitigation controls can reduce exposure

Overrides are never default behaviour.

9. Override Approval Requirements

Each override requires documented approval including:

• Vulnerability ID and description
• Severity and exposure assessment
• Justification for override
• Compensating controls applied
• Named risk owner
• Expiry or review date

Overrides without expiry are invalid.

10. Compensating Controls

When an override is approved, compensating controls may include:

• Feature gating
• Network isolation
• Runtime monitoring
• Access restrictions
• Temporary functionality disablement

Controls must be explicitly documented.

11. Override Tracking & Review

All overrides must be:

• Recorded in the Risk Register
• Linked to the relevant vulnerability
• Reviewed on a defined cadence
• Actively removed when remediation becomes available

Expired overrides are treated as incidents.

12. Tooling & Enforcement

The platform mandates:

• Continuous vulnerability scanning
• CI/CD enforcement of severity thresholds
• Blocking of builds with unresolved critical vulnerabilities

Overrides must be machine-detectable and auditable.

13. Incident Integration

Unmitigated or exploited vulnerabilities must:

• Trigger incident records
• Follow escalation rules
• Update risk assessments

Security debt is not invisible.

14. Audit & Evidence

The platform must be able to demonstrate:

• Vulnerability history
• Remediation timelines
• Override justifications
• Control effectiveness

Evidence must be regulator-ready.

15. Change Control

Changes to this policy require:

• Security authority approval
• Risk reassessment
• Versioned documentation updates

16. Enforcement Rules

• No production deployment with unresolved critical vulnerabilities
• No overrides without approval and expiry
• No silent dependency changes
• No deletion of vulnerability records

Violations block system progression.
