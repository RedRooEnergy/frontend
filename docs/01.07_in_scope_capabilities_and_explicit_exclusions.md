01.07 — In-Scope Capabilities & Explicit Exclusions

Project Name: RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace
Document Type: Foundational Governance Artefact
Phase: Phase 1 — Master Project Definition
Status: DRAFT (to be approved and locked)
Change Control: Not active (pre-baseline)

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the authoritative functional boundaries of the RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace.

It explicitly enumerates:

Capabilities that are in scope and permitted

Capabilities that are explicitly out of scope

Behaviours the platform will never attempt to provide

Once approved, this document becomes the scope enforcement reference for all design, build, review, and audit activities.

2. Governing Principle

The platform is designed as regulated transaction infrastructure, not a general-purpose commerce system.

Accordingly:

Capabilities exist only where governed

Absence of scope definition implies exclusion

Convenience features are rejected if they weaken governance

3. In-Scope Capabilities (Authorised)

The following capabilities are explicitly in scope and form the authorised functional surface of the platform.

3.1 Supplier Governance & Participation

The platform SHALL support:

Governed supplier onboarding workflows

Compliance state enforcement and revocation

Immutable audit trails for supplier actions

Suppliers may only act within permissions defined by their current compliance state.

3.2 Product & Catalogue Governance

The platform SHALL support:

Locked product categories and attribute templates

Mandatory compliance documentation per product

Validation prior to publication

5. Non-Goals (Clarifications)

The following are non-goals of the project:

6. Scope Enforcement

Any proposal to introduce a capability not listed as in scope:
