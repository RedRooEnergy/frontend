21.05 — Environment Credential & Secret Governance

Document ID: 21.05
Title: Environment Credential & Secret Governance
Status: DRAFT → LOCKED UPON APPROVAL
Governing Phase: Phase 21 — Change Control & Post-Baseline Execution

1. Purpose

This document defines mandatory governance rules for the creation, storage, access, rotation, and audit of all credentials and secrets used by the platform.

Secrets are treated as regulated operational assets, not configuration values.

2. Scope of Governance

This governance applies to:

API keys

OAuth tokens

Database credentials

Encryption keys

Certificates

Webhook secrets

CI/CD secrets

Infrastructure credentials

No exceptions.

3. Core Principles

Secrets SHALL never be committed to source control

Secrets SHALL never appear in logs

Secrets SHALL never be shared across environments

Secrets SHALL be rotated on a defined schedule

Access SHALL be least-privilege

4. Approved Storage Locations

Secrets MAY ONLY be stored in:

CI/CD secret stores

Approved secret managers

Encrypted environment variables at runtime

The following are explicitly prohibited:

.env files committed to repositories

Hard-coded secrets in code

Secrets stored in documentation

Secrets shared via messaging tools

5. Environment Isolation

Each environment MUST have:

Separate credentials

Separate access scopes

Separate rotation schedules

Credential reuse across environments is forbidden.

6. Access Control

Access to secrets SHALL:

Be role-based

Be logged

Be reviewed periodically

Be revoked immediately upon role change

Human access is minimized wherever automation is possible.

7. Rotation Policy

Mandatory rotation schedules:

High-risk secrets: ≤ 90 days

Medium-risk secrets: ≤ 180 days

Low-risk secrets: ≤ 365 days

Emergency rotation SHALL be triggered after any suspected compromise.

8. CI/CD Integration Rules

CI/CD pipelines SHALL:

Inject secrets at runtime

Never expose secret values

Mask secrets in logs

Prevent execution if secrets are missing

Pipeline failure due to missing secrets is expected behavior.

9. Incident Handling

Any suspected secret exposure is treated as a Security Incident.

Required actions include:

Immediate revocation

Forced rotation

Impact assessment

Audit logging

Post-incident review

10. Audit & Evidence

The following evidence SHALL be retained:

Access logs

Rotation records

Incident records

Revocation history

Secret values themselves are never retained as evidence.

11. Approval & Lock

Upon approval, this document becomes immutable.
