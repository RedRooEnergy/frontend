19.01 — UAT & Soak Testing Governance Framework
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative governance framework for User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and Soak Testing. It ensures that the platform is validated under realistic usage, sustained load, and prolonged operational conditions before production release.

Testing at this phase is not exploratory; it is confirmatory and evidentiary.

2. Governing Principle

The system must prove stability under sustained, real-world conditions before go-live.

Passing functional tests alone is insufficient.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• End-to-end user workflows
• Long-running background processes
• Payments, escrow, and settlement flows
• Compliance, audit, and reporting pipelines
• Infrastructure and operational stability

It applies to pre-production and staging environments only.

4. UAT Objectives

UAT must validate that:

• Business requirements are met
• Governance rules are enforced end-to-end
• Role-based behaviour matches specification
• User-facing behaviour reflects system truth

UAT is approval-driven, not developer-driven.

5. UAT Participants

UAT must involve:

• Business stakeholders
• Governance representatives
• Operational users (buyer, supplier, admin roles)

Developers may support but must not self-approve outcomes.

6. UAT Test Case Governance

UAT test cases must be:

• Derived from locked requirements
• Traceable to governance documents
• Version-controlled and immutable once approved

Ad-hoc acceptance is prohibited.

7. UAT Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria must be:

• Explicit
• Measurable
• Binary (pass/fail)

Partial acceptance is not permitted.

8. Soak Testing Objectives

Soak testing must validate:

• System stability over extended periods
• Resource utilisation trends
• Memory, connection, and queue leakage
• Long-running job reliability

Short-duration load tests are insufficient substitutes.

9. Soak Test Duration & Load

Soak tests must:

• Run for defined minimum durations
• Simulate realistic production load
• Include background jobs and integrations

Duration and load profiles must be documented.

10. Monitoring During Soak Tests

During soak testing, monitoring must capture:

• Performance metrics
• Error rates
• Alert frequency
• Resource saturation signals

All alerts must be reviewed, not ignored.

11. Failure Classification

Failures observed during UAT or soak testing must be classified as:

• Critical (blocking release)
• Major (must be remediated)
• Minor (may be deferred with approval)

Classification decisions must be recorded.

12. Defect Management

Defects must be:

• Logged formally
• Linked to test cases
• Assigned ownership
• Retested after remediation

Untracked defects are prohibited.

13. Retesting & Regression

All fixes must undergo:

• Targeted retesting
• Regression testing of impacted areas

Regression gaps invalidate test results.

14. Evidence Collection

UAT and soak testing must produce:

• Test execution logs
• Results summaries
• Approval sign-offs
• Identified defect records

These artefacts are audit-eligible.

15. Approval & Sign-Off

UAT and soak testing require:

• Formal completion declaration
• Sign-off by authorised roles
• Recorded approval timestamps

Go-live without sign-off is prohibited.

16. Exit Criteria

Phase 19.01 is complete only when:

• All critical tests pass
• No unresolved blocking defects remain
• Evidence artefacts are stored in the DMS
