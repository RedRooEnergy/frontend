10.02 — Category & Attribute Governance System
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative category and attribute governance system that underpins all product definition, validation, and catalogue scalability. It establishes how categories are created, locked, versioned, and enforced, and how attributes are governed to prevent schema drift and regulatory inconsistency.

Categories are structural governance artefacts, not UI groupings.

2. Governance Doctrine

Categories define what may exist. Attributes define how it must be described.

The system must ensure that:

• All products conform to a locked category schema
• Attribute definitions are governed, typed, and validated
• Category changes are controlled and versioned
• Schema drift is structurally impossible

No product may define its own schema.

3. Scope

This document governs:

• Category creation and lifecycle
• Attribute definition and enforcement
• Category–attribute binding
• Versioning and immutability rules
• Cross-extension dependency guarantees

Out of scope:

• Product submission workflows (10.03)
• Pricing and promotions (Phase 6)
• Compliance matrix definition (Phase 4)

4. Category Definition

A Category is a governed, immutable schema definition consisting of:

• Category identifier (immutable)
• Category name (unique)
• Description and regulatory intent
• Jurisdictional applicability
• Attribute template reference
• Version identifier
• Approval metadata
• Hash for integrity verification

Once active, a category version is immutable.

5. Category Lifecycle States

Canonical states:

• Draft
• Approved
• Active
• Deprecated
• Retired

Rules:

• Only Active categories accept new products
• Deprecated categories allow existing products only
• Retired categories prohibit all product association

No category may be deleted.

6. Attribute Definition

An Attribute is a governed field definition with:

• Attribute identifier
• Name and description
• Data type (string, number, enum, boolean, etc.)
• Validation constraints
• Mandatory/optional flag
• Regulatory relevance indicator

Attributes are schema-level artefacts, not per-product fields.

7. Attribute Data Types & Constraints

Permitted data types include:

• String (bounded, validated)
• Numeric (with units and ranges)
• Enumeration (explicit allowed values)
• Boolean
• Structured objects (governed only)

Free-form text for regulated values is prohibited.

8. Mandatory vs Optional Attributes

Rules:

• Mandatory attributes must be present for submission
• Optional attributes must still conform to type constraints
• Regulatory attributes are always mandatory

Missing mandatory attributes block submission.

9. Category–Attribute Binding

Each category must reference:

• Exactly one attribute template
• A fixed set of attributes with defined roles

Attribute templates cannot be overridden at the product level.

10. Versioning Strategy

Category and attribute changes require:

• New version creation
• Formal governance approval
• Explicit migration rules (if applicable)

Existing products remain bound to their original category version unless explicitly migrated under governance control.

11. Immutability Enforcement

Once a category or attribute version is active:

• Definitions cannot be edited
• Constraints cannot be relaxed
• Attributes cannot be removed

Violations are treated as governance breaches.

12. Jurisdictional & Regulatory Mapping

Categories must support:

• Jurisdictional applicability flags
• Regulatory dependency references
• Compliance matrix linkage

This enables regulatory enforcement without per-product logic.

13. Change Control Rules

Category or attribute changes require:

• Change request documentation
• Impact assessment
• Approval under change-control governance
• Version increment

Ad-hoc changes are prohibited.

14. Extension Interaction Rules

Other extensions may:

• Query category and attribute schemas
• Validate product submissions against schemas

They may not:

• Modify schemas
• Create ad-hoc attributes
• Override validation rules

Schema authority remains centralised.

15. Audit & Evidence

Every category or attribute action must log:

• Actor identity
• Previous and new version identifiers
• Governing artefact references
• Timestamp

Audit records are immutable and regulator-exportable.

16. Scalability Guarantees

This system ensures:

• Catalogue growth without schema chaos
• Backward compatibility for existing products
• Predictable validation behaviour
• Regulator-safe evolution

17. Non-Functional Guarantees

Category & attribute governance prioritises:

• Structural correctness over flexibility
• Governance over speed
• Predictability over convenience
