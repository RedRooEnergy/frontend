06.02 — Pricing Integrity & Margin Floor Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the non-negotiable governance rules that preserve pricing integrity and enforce minimum margin floors across all marketplace transactions.

Pricing is treated as a regulated artefact, not a UI value or negotiable convenience.

2. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Product pricing
• Supplier pricing inputs
• Buyer incentives and discounts
• Promotions and campaigns
• Negotiated orders
• Catalogue visibility pricing
• Settlement calculations

No pricing surface is excluded.

3. Pricing Integrity Doctrine

The platform enforces the following principles:

• Pricing must be deterministic
• Pricing must be reproducible
• Pricing must be auditable
• Pricing must be immutable post-commitment

Any ambiguity in pricing is a governance failure.

4. Authoritative Price Composition

Every price presented to a buyer must be composed of:

• Base product price
• Shipping and customs (DDP)
• Applicable taxes
• Approved fees
• Approved incentives or discounts

No implicit or derived values outside this structure are permitted.

5. Margin Floor Definition

A margin floor is the minimum allowable margin required to:

• Cover platform operational costs
• Support compliance and audit obligations
• Protect against loss-making transactions

Margin floors may vary by:

• Product category
• Supplier tier
• Transaction type

All floors must be explicitly defined.

6. Margin Floor Enforcement

The platform must enforce margin floors:

• At product submission
• At catalogue generation
• At checkout
• During negotiated pricing

Any transaction violating margin floors is blocked by design.

7. Discount & Incentive Interaction Rules

Discounts and incentives must:

• Apply in a defined order
• Respect margin floors after application
• Be capped where required
• Be auditable

Discount stacking without governance approval is prohibited.

8. Supplier Pricing Constraints

Suppliers may:

• Set base prices within allowed ranges
• Participate in approved promotions
• Offer volume pricing where enabled

Suppliers may not:

• Undercut margin floors
• Bypass pricing validation
• Apply hidden rebates

Supplier pricing is always validated by the platform.

9. Promotional Pricing Governance

Promotional pricing requires:

• Prior approval (where applicable)
• Defined start and end dates
• Clear eligibility rules
• Inclusion in pricing snapshots

Expired or unauthorised promotions are invalid.

10. Negotiated Pricing Governance

Negotiated pricing must:

• Follow an explicit workflow
• Be approved by authorised roles
• Generate a locked pricing snapshot
• Remain immutable once accepted

Verbal or informal pricing agreements are prohibited.

11. Pricing Snapshot Integration

Pricing integrity is enforced through:

• Snapshot generation at commitment
• Cryptographic hashing
• Snapshot reference in orders, payments, and audits

No financial action occurs without a valid snapshot.

12. Rounding & Currency Rules

The platform must define:

• Currency normalisation rules
• Rounding standards
• Exchange rate sources

Inconsistent rounding is treated as a defect.

13. Audit & Evidence Requirements

The system must support:

• Reconstruction of price calculations
• Margin verification
• Incentive application proof
• Settlement traceability

Pricing artefacts are legal evidence.

14. Exception Handling

Pricing exceptions require:

• Documented justification
• Explicit approval
• Risk register entry
• Defined expiry

Exceptions without expiry are invalid.

15. Change Control

Changes to pricing or margin rules require:

• Commercial approval
• Risk assessment
• Legal review (where applicable)
• Versioned documentation update

Retroactive pricing changes are prohibited.

16. Enforcement Rules

• No order without pricing validation
• No discount below margin floors
• No settlement without snapshot verification
• No manual price overrides

Violations block transactions.
