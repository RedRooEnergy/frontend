4.04 — Reviews & Ratings Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance framework for reviews and ratings within the marketplace, ensuring feedback is truthful, non-manipulable, audit-ready, and incapable of influencing transactions outside governed rules.

Reviews are treated as regulated signals, not marketing content.

2. Governing Principle

Feedback informs trust.
Governance preserves integrity.

Reviews must reflect verified transactional reality, not opinion detached from system truth.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Buyer reviews of products
• Buyer ratings of suppliers
• Supplier responses to reviews
• Moderation and escalation workflows
• Review data retention and export

Out of scope:

• Marketing testimonials outside the platform
• Third-party review aggregation

4. Eligibility Rules

A review may only be submitted if:

• The buyer completed a verified order
• The product was delivered or resolved
• The review window is open
• The buyer identity is authenticated

Unverified or anonymous reviews are prohibited.

5. Review Timing Constraints

Reviews may be submitted only:

• After delivery confirmation, or
• After a governed case closure

Reviews submitted during open disputes are blocked.

6. Rating Structure

Ratings must:

• Use a fixed, defined scale
• Be consistently applied platform-wide
• Be immutable once submitted

Score manipulation is prohibited.

7. Review Content Rules

Reviews must not contain:

• Personal data
• Defamatory statements
• Regulatory misrepresentations
• Threats or coercion

Content is governed, not free-form.

8. Supplier Response Governance

Suppliers may respond only:

• Once per review
• Within a defined response window
• Without altering review content

Responses are append-only.

9. Moderation Authority Model

Moderation may occur only if:

• Content violates governance rules
• Legal or regulatory risk is present
• Abuse or fraud indicators exist

Moderation decisions are auditable.

10. Review Removal Rules

Reviews may be removed only if:

• Governance breach is proven
• Legal obligation requires removal
• Fraudulent activity is confirmed

Negative sentiment alone is insufficient.

11. Visibility Controls

Review visibility may be affected by:

• Compliance state changes
• Supplier suspension
• Product delisting

Visibility changes do not alter stored data.

12. Weighting & Aggregation

Aggregated ratings must:

• Reflect only eligible reviews
• Exclude moderated or invalid entries
• Preserve historical weighting rules

Aggregation logic is versioned.

13. Anti-Gaming Controls

The platform must prevent:

• Review incentivisation
• Reciprocal rating schemes
• Artificial inflation or suppression

Detection triggers escalation.

14. Audit & Evidence

Each review must retain:

• Order reference
• Buyer identity hash
• Timestamp and state
• Moderation actions

Review data is regulator-exportable.

15. Data Retention

Review records must be retained:

• For the life of the platform, or
• As required by regulation

Deletion requires formal approval.

16. Reporting & Export

The system must support:

• Regulator exports
• Supplier performance reporting
• Internal trust analytics

Exports must be reproducible.

17. Change Control

Any change affecting:

• Review eligibility
• Moderation logic
• Aggregation rules

Requires governance approval.

18. Enforcement Status

This governance is:

• Mandatory
• Runtime-enforced
• Non-bypassable

Manual overrides are prohibited.
