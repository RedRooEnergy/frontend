21.06 — Repository Structure, Branch Protection & Release Governance

Document ID: 21.06
Title: Repository Structure, Branch Protection & Release Governance
Status: DRAFT → LOCKED UPON APPROVAL
Governing Phase: Phase 21 — Change Control & Post-Baseline Execution

1. Purpose

This document defines mandatory governance for:

Repository structure

Branching model

Merge protection

Release creation

Production promotion

These rules ensure auditability, traceability, and controlled change.

2. Repository Structure Governance

The repository SHALL be organised into clearly defined top-level domains:

/core — Immutable Core platform

/extensions — Versioned, independently governed extensions

/docs — Governance, operational, and compliance documentation

/infra — Infrastructure-as-code (where applicable)

/scripts — Controlled automation utilities

No cross-contamination between domains is permitted.

3. Core Immutability Rule

The Core is immutable once locked.

Changes to /core require:

Formal Change Control Request (CCR)

Risk assessment

Explicit approval

Version increment

Audit entry

Hotfixes are not exempt.

4. Branching Model

Mandatory branches:

main — Locked, production-ready baseline

develop — Approved integration branch

feature/* — Scoped, time-limited work

hotfix/* — Emergency fixes (approval still required)

Direct commits to main are forbidden.

5. Branch Protection Rules

The following protections SHALL be enforced on main and develop:

No direct pushes

Mandatory pull requests

Required approvals

CI checks must pass

No force-pushes

History rewrite disabled

Branch protection is not optional.

6. Pull Request Governance

Every pull request SHALL include:

Scope description

Linked CCR (if applicable)

Risk classification

Test evidence

Reviewer sign-off

PRs without governance metadata are invalid.

7. Release Governance

Releases SHALL:

Be cut from main

Carry immutable version numbers

Include release notes

Reference approved changes only

Be cryptographically verifiable where possible

Manual production changes are forbidden.

8. Emergency Changes

Emergency changes REQUIRE:

Documented justification

Post-incident review

Retroactive CCR

Audit entry

Speed does not bypass governance.

9. Decommissioning & Rollback

Rollback procedures SHALL:

Reference the previous locked release

Preserve audit trails

Avoid destructive operations

Be tested prior to necessity

Rollback is a controlled action, not a panic response.

10. Audit & Evidence

The following records SHALL be retained:

Branch protection settings

PR approvals

CI results

Release manifests

Change logs

11. Approval & Lock

Upon approval, this governance becomes mandatory and immutable.
