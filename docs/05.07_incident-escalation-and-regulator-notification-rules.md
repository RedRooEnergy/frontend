05.07 — Incident Escalation & Regulator Notification Rules
1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory escalation pathways and regulator notification rules for incidents, breaches, and risk events affecting the marketplace.

Escalation and notification are legal and governance obligations, not discretionary operational decisions.

2. Scope

These rules apply to all incidents that may involve:

• Regulatory obligations
• Legal exposure
• Financial loss or misallocation
• Data integrity or confidentiality
• System-wide operational impact
• Supplier or buyer harm

No incident category is exempt.

3. Escalation Principles

The platform enforces the following principles:

• Escalate based on impact, not certainty
• When in doubt, escalate
• Time-bound escalation is mandatory
• Silence or delay increases liability

Failure to escalate is itself a governance breach.

4. Incident Severity Levels

Incidents must be escalated according to severity:

Informational
• Logged only
• No external notification
• Periodic review

Minor
• Internal notification
• Local remediation
• Management visibility

Major
• Executive notification
• Legal assessment
• Risk register update

Critical
• Immediate executive escalation
• Legal and compliance engagement
• Regulator notification assessment

Severity reassessment is permitted as facts emerge.

5. Mandatory Escalation Timelines

Escalation must occur within:

• Informational: ≤ 5 business days
• Minor: ≤ 24 hours
• Major: ≤ 8 hours
• Critical: ≤ 1 hour

Delays must be documented and justified.

6. Escalation Authority

Each escalation level requires notification to:

• Risk owner
• Governance authority
• Legal counsel (where applicable)
• Executive authority (major/critical)

Escalation paths must be predefined and documented.

7. Regulator Notification Triggers

Regulator notification must be evaluated when incidents involve:

• Breach of law or regulation
• Compromise of regulated data
• Payment system integrity failures
• Safety or compliance violations
• Material financial loss

Notification assessment is mandatory, even if notification is not ultimately required.

8. Regulator Notification Timelines

Where notification is required:

• Statutory timelines must be observed
• Notifications must be accurate and complete
• Preliminary notices may precede full reports

Failure to notify within statutory timeframes is a critical breach.

9. Notification Content Requirements

Regulator notifications must include:

• Incident description and timeline
• Impact assessment
• Affected systems and parties
• Containment actions taken
• Planned remediation
• Contact point for follow-up

Speculation is prohibited.

10. Evidence Preservation

Prior to notification:

• Evidence must be preserved
• Logs must be secured
• Access must be restricted

Evidence tampering is prohibited.

11. Communication Controls

External communications must be:

• Approved by legal authority
• Consistent with regulator disclosures
• Logged and auditable

Unauthorised disclosure is a breach.

12. Post-Notification Obligations

Following notification:

• Ongoing updates may be required
• Remediation progress must be tracked
• Risk register entries must be updated

Regulator engagement is continuous until closure.

13. Audit & Reporting

Escalation and notification records must support:

• Regulatory inspection
• Legal defence
• Internal audits
• Insurance claims

Reconstruction of timelines must be possible.

14. Change Control

Changes to escalation or notification rules require:

• Legal review
• Governance approval
• Versioned documentation update

Emergency changes remain auditable.

15. Enforcement Rules

• No suppression of reportable incidents
• No delay without documented justification
• No unauthorised regulator contact
• No deletion of escalation records

Violations block system progression.
