05.02 — Risk Register & Control Mapping Doctrine
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative structure, governance rules, and enforcement requirements for the Risk Register and its mandatory mapping to system controls.

The Risk Register is the single source of truth for all identified risks across the platform.

2. Doctrine Statement

Risk is not managed informally.

No risk exists unless it is:

• Explicitly recorded
• Categorised
• Assessed
• Owned
• Controlled
• Reviewed

Unrecorded risk is treated as non-compliant system behaviour.

3. Authoritative Risk Register

The platform shall maintain a single authoritative Risk Register that:

• Is version-controlled
• Is immutable once approved
• Is auditable
• Is regulator-reviewable

No parallel or informal risk lists are permitted.

4. Mandatory Risk Register Fields

Each risk entry must include, at minimum:

• Risk ID (unique, non-reusable)
• Risk title
• Detailed description
• Risk category
• Likelihood rating
• Impact rating
• Detectability rating
• Derived risk severity
• Risk owner
• Governance domain
• Associated controls
• Risk status
• Review frequency
• Creation date
• Approval reference

Incomplete entries are invalid.

5. Risk Identification Rules

Risks must be logged when identified through:

• Design activities
• Compliance mapping
• Incidents or near-misses
• Audit findings
• Monitoring alerts
• Third-party notifications

Risk logging is mandatory and time-bound.

6. Control Mapping Requirement

Every risk must be mapped to one or more controls.

Controls may be:

• Governance documents
• Technical enforcement mechanisms
• Automated validation logic
• Monitoring and alerting systems
• Procedural constraints

A risk without mapped controls is considered unmitigated.

7. Control Effectiveness Classification

Each mapped control must be classified as:

• Preventive
• Detective
• Corrective

Control effectiveness must be assessed and documented.

8. Residual Risk Assessment

After control mapping, each risk must include:

• Residual likelihood
• Residual impact
• Residual severity

Residual high-risk items require escalation.

9. Risk Ownership & Accountability

Each risk must have:

• A named risk owner
• A defined escalation authority
• Clear accountability for review and mitigation

Risk ownership cannot be delegated implicitly.

10. Review & Update Cadence

Risks must be reviewed:

• On a scheduled basis
• After incidents
• Following regulatory changes
• After material system changes

Review outcomes must be recorded.

11. Risk Status Lifecycle

Valid risk statuses include:

• Identified
• Assessed
• Mitigated
• Accepted
• Escalated
• Closed

Status transitions must be auditable.

12. Change Control

Changes to the Risk Register require:

• Formal justification
• Approval by the appropriate authority
• Version increment
• Audit record update

Risk deletions are prohibited; risks may only be closed.

13. Audit & Evidence Requirements

The Risk Register must support:

• Regulator inspection
• Audit evidence export
• Historical state reconstruction

Evidence must be cryptographically verifiable where applicable.

14. Enforcement Rules

• No deployment with unmitigated critical risks
• No payment flows without risk coverage
• No supplier onboarding without risk review
• No exception handling without recorded risk

Violations block progression.
