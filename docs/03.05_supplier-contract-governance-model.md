03.05 — Supplier Contract Governance Model
1. Purpose

This document defines the legal and system-governed contractual framework under which suppliers participate in the marketplace.

Its objectives are to:

• Ensure suppliers are bound by enforceable agreements
• Align legal obligations with system-enforced behaviour
• Prevent informal or implied supplier participation
• Enable compliance enforcement, suspension, and revocation
• Provide regulator- and court-defensible supplier records

Suppliers do not “use” the platform.
They are contractually governed participants.

2. Governing Principles

Supplier contracting adheres to the following principles:

• No supplier access without executed contract
• No contract without verified legal identity
• No deviation from approved contract templates
• No operational override of contractual rules
• System state reflects contractual state

Supplier contracts are foundational controls, not administrative formalities.

3. Scope of Supplier Contracts

This governance applies to:

• Manufacturer suppliers
• Distributors and wholesalers
• Compliance service partners (where applicable)
• Logistics-linked suppliers
• Any entity offering goods or services via the platform

4. Mandatory Supplier Contract Types

Each supplier must execute, at minimum:

Master Supplier Agreement (MSA)

Compliance & Certification Undertaking

Data Handling & Confidentiality Addendum

Platform Rules & Conduct Schedule

Optional addenda may apply based on role or jurisdiction.

5. Contract Formation Process

Supplier contracts are formed only through a governed workflow:

Legal entity verification completed

Contract package generated from approved templates

Jurisdiction and governing law confirmed

Digital execution via approved provider

Acceptance logged, hashed, and archived

Supplier status activated in system

Manual or out-of-band agreements are invalid.

6. Authority & Execution

Supplier contracts may only be executed by:

• Authorised representative of the supplier entity
• Platform contracting authority as defined in 03.04

The system must verify:

• Signatory identity
• Authority representation
• Execution completeness

7. Contract–System Binding

Once executed, supplier contracts directly govern:

• Permitted product categories
• Required certifications
• Pricing and margin constraints
• Delivery and logistics obligations
• Audit and inspection rights
• Suspension and termination triggers

The platform enforces the contract; it does not merely reference it.

8. Breach, Suspension & Termination
8.1 Breach Detection

Breaches may arise from:

• Compliance failure
• Misrepresentation
• Pricing manipulation
• Document falsification
• Delivery failure
• Regulatory action

Detection may be automated or manual.

8.2 Suspension Rules

Upon breach:

• Supplier listing visibility may be restricted
• New orders may be blocked
• Funds may be held or frozen
• Incident records created

Suspension is a governed state, not an admin choice.

8.3 Termination

Termination occurs only where:

• Contractual thresholds are met
• Legal review confirms grounds
• Evidence is preserved
• System records are locked

Post-termination data is retained per retention doctrine.

9. Supplier Obligations

Suppliers are contractually required to:

• Maintain valid certifications
• Provide accurate product data
• Comply with pricing rules
• Cooperate with audits
• Accept dispute outcomes
• Retain records as required

Failure to comply triggers enforcement.

10. Platform Rights

The platform retains the right to:

• Audit supplier records
• Verify certifications independently
• Suspend access for risk containment
• Report non-compliance to regulators
• Enforce penalties as contractually permitted

11. Prohibited Supplier Actions

Suppliers may not:

• Bypass onboarding workflows
• List products outside approval
• Modify governed terms
• Interact with buyers off-platform
• Circumvent pricing enforcement

Any attempt is a contractual breach.

12. Change Control

Supplier contract terms may only change via:

• Legal amendment
• Versioned contract update
• Supplier re-acceptance
• System rule update

13. Status

Status: DRAFT
Becomes immutable when approved and locked under Phase 3
