07.03 — Audit Logging & Immutability

Version: v0.2 DRAFT
Phase: 7 — Core Data Models & Immutability
Upstream Dependencies: 07.02 — Identity, Authentication & Role Enforcement
Downstream Dependencies: 07.04 — Document Integrity & Hashing
Status: DRAFT (Lock-Ready)

1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative audit logging rules for the Immutable Core, ensuring forensic traceability, non-repudiation, and regulator-grade auditability.

2. Governing Principle

If it changes state, it leaves a trace.

Audit logs are immutable, append-only, and authoritative.

3. Audit Scope Boundary — 07.03.X

Audit logging applies to all:

• State-changing events
• Security-relevant actions
• Financial transactions
• Compliance-relevant operations
• Governance-significant decisions

The following are explicitly out of scope, unless required by regulation:

• Non-persistent UI rendering
• Transient client-side views
• Read-only data access without state mutation

This boundary prevents audit overreach while preserving audit strength.

4. Immutability

• Audit events are append-only
• Deletion or modification is prohibited
• Ordering must be preserved

5. Status

Status: DRAFT
Lock Intent: READY
Change Control: REQUIRED post-ETG-001
