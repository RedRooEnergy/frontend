02.02 — Authoritative 17-Category DMS Structure Specification
1. Purpose

This document defines the single, authoritative Document Management System (DMS) category structure for the marketplace project.

This structure governs all documents produced for the platform, including governance artefacts, legal documents, technical specifications, operational manuals, audit records, and evidence packs.

No alternative structures, parallel repositories, or informal storage locations are permitted.

Once approved, this structure is immutable unless modified through formal change control.

2. Governing Principles

The DMS is designed to satisfy:

• Regulatory scrutiny
• Audit defensibility
• Legal traceability
• Long-term maintainability
• Immutable evidence preservation

Accordingly:

• Every document must belong to exactly one category
• No document may exist outside the DMS
• Categories are fixed, numbered, and permanent
• Category numbers are semantic identifiers and must never be reused
• Folder names are descriptive but the number is authoritative

3. The 17 Authoritative DMS Categories

The following 17 categories form the entire allowable DMS universe.

No additional top-level categories may be created.

01 — Governance & Project Definition

Project purpose, scope, doctrine, architecture lock, decision authority, and foundational governance artefacts.

02 — Document Control & Records Governance

DMS rules, naming standards, versioning, approval workflows, immutability doctrine, retention, and disclosure policies.

03 — Legal & Corporate Structure

Entity structures, IP ownership, licensing, inter-company agreements, contracting authority, and solicitor-ready materials.

04 — Regulatory & Compliance Framework

Regulatory identification, compliance matrices, certification rules, validation logic, revocation rules, and regulator-ready mappings.

05 — Risk, Incident & Security Governance

Enterprise risk frameworks, risk registers, breach response, escalation rules, cybersecurity doctrine, and incident audit requirements.

06 — Commercial, Pricing & Financial Governance

Marketplace revenue models, pricing integrity rules, margin floors, discount governance, settlement logic, and monetisation policies.

07 — Core Data Models & Immutability

08 — Immutable Core Platform

Core platform specifications, enforcement mechanisms, authentication, RBAC, audit logging, and governance hooks.

09 — Supplier Onboarding & Governance

Supplier identity verification, compliance workflows, approval states, revocation handling, and audit trails.

4. Category Usage Rules

• Each document must reside in exactly one category
• Cross-references must link, not duplicate
• Documents may reference multiple categories, but belong to one
• Evidence packs inherit the category of the initiating case
• No category may be subdivided into alternative numbering systems

5. Enforcement

The following are explicitly prohibited:

• Creating documents outside the DMS
• Creating unnumbered folders
• Creating “draft”, “misc”, or “working” categories
• Using cloud storage, email, or chat as document stores
• Renaming categories after approval

Violations constitute a governance breach.

6. Change Control

Any modification to this structure requires:

• Formal change request
• Risk assessment
• Impact analysis across all extensions
• Approval by designated governing authority

Until approved, this structure is final.

7. Status
