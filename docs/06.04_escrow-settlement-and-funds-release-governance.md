06.04 — Escrow, Settlement & Funds Release Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory governance rules controlling how buyer funds are held, released, split, refunded, or reversed within the marketplace.

Funds flow is treated as a regulated financial process, not an operational convenience.

2. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Buyer payments
• Escrow holding mechanisms
• Supplier settlement
• Platform fee extraction
• Refunds and reversals
• Dispute-related fund handling

No monetary movement is out of scope.

3. Core Funds Flow Principle

No funds are released without verified conditions being met.

Funds movement is governed by state, evidence, and auditability, not user intent.

4. Escrow Doctrine

All buyer payments must:

• Enter escrow upon authorisation
• Remain held until release conditions are satisfied
• Be traceable to a pricing snapshot

Direct pass-through payments are prohibited.

5. Escrow Preconditions

Funds may only enter escrow when:

• A valid pricing snapshot exists
• Snapshot hash verification passes
• Compliance state is valid
• Payment provider authorisation succeeds

Failure at any step blocks the transaction.

6. Escrow Release Conditions

Escrow funds may only be released when all applicable conditions are met:

• Delivery confirmation received
• Compliance obligations satisfied
• Dispute windows expired or resolved
• No active incident blocking settlement

Release is state-driven and deterministic.

7. Partial Releases & Milestones

Where applicable, escrow may support:

• Milestone-based releases
• Partial supplier settlements

Milestones must be pre-defined and auditable.

8. Funds Splitting Rules

Settlement logic must:

• Split funds deterministically
• Respect platform fees
• Respect supplier entitlements

Split logic must reference the pricing snapshot.

Service partner payments are not processed by RRE and are out of scope for escrow and settlement. RRE only records a 1% connection fee at marketplace level.

9. Settlement Timing Rules

Settlement timing must:

• Be explicitly defined
• Respect cooling-off periods
• Comply with regulatory requirements

Manual acceleration of settlement is prohibited.

10. Refund Governance

Refunds may occur due to:

• Buyer cancellation (where permitted)
• Failed delivery
• Compliance failure
• Dispute resolution

Refund calculations must reference the original pricing snapshot.

11. Dispute-Linked Holds

Active disputes may:

• Freeze escrow funds
• Delay settlement
• Trigger partial reversals

Dispute status directly affects fund availability.

12. Provider-Agnostic Enforcement

All payment providers must:

• Enforce escrow semantics
• Respect release conditions
• Support audit-grade reporting

Provider limitations must not weaken governance.

13. Audit & Evidence

Funds flow must be supported by:

• Escrow state records
• Release condition evidence
• Settlement logs
• Payment provider confirmations

Financial records are legal artefacts.

14. Failure & Exception Handling

Settlement failures must:

• Trigger incident records
• Block further releases
• Preserve fund state

Silent failures are prohibited.

15. Change Control

Changes to escrow or settlement rules require:

• Financial approval
• Legal review
• Risk assessment
• Versioned documentation update

Retroactive changes are prohibited.

16. Enforcement Rules

• No settlement without escrow
• No escrow release without verification
• No manual fund overrides
• No untraceable fund movement

Violations block system progression.
