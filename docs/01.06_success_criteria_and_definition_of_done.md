01.06 — Success Criteria & Definition of “Done”

Project Name: RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace
Document Type: Foundational Governance Artefact
Phase: Phase 1 — Master Project Definition
Status: DRAFT (to be approved and locked)
Change Control: Not active (pre-baseline)

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines objective success criteria and a formal Definition of “Done” for the RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace.

It exists to eliminate ambiguity, prevent premature completion claims, and ensure that delivery is judged by governance, correctness, and audit-readiness, not by perceived progress or feature volume.

2. Governing Principle

A deliverable, phase, or the overall project is considered DONE only when:

It satisfies all applicable governance artefacts

It meets defined success criteria

It produces verifiable evidence of completion

It can withstand independent inspection

Absence of defects is insufficient. Demonstrated compliance and traceability are required.

3. Project-Level Success Criteria

The project is considered successful only when all of the following are true.

3.1 Governance Integrity

All required governance documents exist, are approved, and are version-locked

Governance artefacts are internally consistent and enforceable

No undocumented rules exist in code or configuration

3.2 Functional Completeness

The Immutable Core is implemented and locked

All defined Extensions operate without bypassing Core enforcement

End-to-end transaction flows function as governed

3.3 Compliance & Audit Readiness

Regulatory obligations are enforced in-system

Audit logs, evidence packs, and exports are reproducible

Third-party review can reconstruct decisions and events

3.4 Financial Integrity

Pricing snapshots are immutable and verifiable

Payments cannot be released without satisfaction of governing conditions

Refunds, disputes, and adjustments are auditable

3.5 Operational Resilience

Failure scenarios are handled gracefully

Incidents are logged, escalated, and reviewable

Recovery does not compromise data integrity

3.6 Controlled Extensibility

Extensions can be added or upgraded without modifying the Core

Versioning and change control prevent regression

Governance remains enforceable over time

4. Phase-Level Definition of “Done”

Each phase is considered DONE only when all listed exit criteria are met and formally acknowledged.

4.1 Documentation Phases (Phases 1–7)

A documentation phase is DONE when:

All required documents exist

Documents are internally consistent

Approval status is recorded

Version numbers are applied

Documents are placed in the correct DMS location

Drafts, placeholders, or partial artefacts do not qualify.

4.2 Build Phases (Phases 8–15)

A build phase is DONE when:

Implementation aligns with governing documents

No governance bypass paths exist

Tests cover both success and failure scenarios

Audit artefacts are generated automatically

Feature visibility alone is insufficient.

4.3 Assurance Phases (Phases 16–19)

An assurance phase is DONE when:

Independent verification is possible

Reports and exports are reproducible

Failure modes have been exercised

Observability confirms expected behaviour

4.4 Deployment Phase (Phase 20)

Deployment is DONE only when:

Production hosting is live

Governance enforcement is active

Baseline lock is applied

Formal change control is activated

5. Artefact-Level Definition of “Done”

An individual artefact (document, service, extension, report) is DONE only when:

It has a clear owner

Its purpose is documented

Its inputs and outputs are defined

Its constraints are enforced

Its evidence trail is complete

Artefacts without owners or governance context are invalid.

6. Explicit Anti-Criteria (What Is NOT “Done”)

The following do not constitute completion:

Code without governance mapping

UI without backend enforcement

Passing tests without audit coverage

Features that “work” but are not governable

Documentation without approval

7. Verification & Evidence

Completion must be supported by:

Documented approvals

Logged execution traces

Hash-verifiable artefacts

Reproducible outputs

Assertions without evidence are invalid.

8. Change Sensitivity

Any modification to success criteria or the Definition of “Done”:

Is considered foundational

Requires formal change control

Triggers re-evaluation of affected phases

9. Approval and Locking

Upon approval, this document shall be:

Marked APPROVED

Version-locked

Used as the authoritative completion standard

Enforced during reviews and audits
