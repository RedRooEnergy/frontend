13.02 — Buyer Browsing & Product Discovery Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance rules controlling how buyers browse, discover, filter, and view products within the marketplace.

Its purpose is to ensure that product discovery is compliance-safe, truthful, non-misleading, and fully governed, preventing the exposure of unapproved, speculative, or non-compliant products.

2. Governing Principle

Discovery reveals only what the system is authorised to sell.

Buyer browsing is not exploratory; it is constrained by governance state.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Marketplace home pages
• Category pages
• Search results
• Filters and sorting
• Featured listings
• Promotional placement

Out of scope:

• External marketing websites
• Third-party search engines

4. Eligibility for Buyer Visibility

A product is eligible for buyer visibility only if:

• Supplier is fully approved
• Product is approved and published
• Mandatory compliance documents are validated
• Category and attribute rules are satisfied
• Commercial rules permit listing

Failure of any condition removes visibility.

5. Category Governance

Products may only appear:

• Within approved categories
• Under locked category definitions
• Using authorised attribute schemas

Category drift is prohibited.

6. Search Governance

Search results must:

• Exclude unpublished products
• Exclude revoked or suspended items
• Respect jurisdictional restrictions
• Reflect live governance state

Search does not surface drafts or pending items.

7. Filtering Rules

Buyer filters may operate on:

• Category
• Approved attributes
• Price (derived values)
• Availability status

Filters may not infer or expose internal states.

8. Sorting Rules

Sorting may be applied by:

• Price
• Popularity (governed metrics only)
• Availability
• Approved promotional ranking

Sorting must never privilege non-compliant products.

9. Featured & Promotional Placement

Featured placement requires:

• Approved promotion governance
• Valid promotion window
• Category compatibility

Promotions cannot override compliance rules.

10. Product Card Integrity

Product cards must display:

• Approved product name
• Governed pricing range
• Verified supplier identity
• Compliance indicators (where applicable)

No speculative claims are permitted.

11. Jurisdictional Visibility Controls

Product visibility must adapt to:

• Buyer jurisdiction
• Regulatory constraints
• Certification applicability

Visibility is contextual and enforced.

12. Inventory & Availability Representation

Availability indicators must:

• Reflect actual fulfilment capability
• Avoid optimistic estimates
• Update dynamically based on system state

Over-promise is prohibited.

13. Pricing Visibility

Displayed pricing must:

• Be derived from live pricing engines
• Reflect incentives transparently
• Exclude unqualified discounts

Estimated pricing must be clearly labelled.

14. Compliance Disclosure

Where applicable, discovery views must:

• Indicate compliance status
• Provide access to certifications
• Avoid misrepresentation

Disclosure supports informed decisions.

15. Error Handling in Discovery

If discovery systems fail:

• Products default to hidden
• Buyers see neutral error states
• No partial or stale data is shown

Fail-safe behaviour is mandatory.

16. Logging & Auditability

Discovery actions must log:

• Search queries
• Filter usage
• Product impressions

Logs support audit and analytics without influencing eligibility.

17. Abuse Prevention

The system must prevent:

• Visibility of revoked products
• Manual surfacing of restricted items
• SEO-driven bypass of governance

Governance overrides marketing.

18. Change Control

Any change affecting:

• Discovery rules
• Visibility logic
• Promotion mechanics

Requires formal governance approval.

19. Enforcement Status

This governance is:

• Mandatory
• Runtime-enforced
• Non-bypassable

UI experiments are constrained.
