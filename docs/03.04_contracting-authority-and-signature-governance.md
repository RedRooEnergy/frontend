03.04 — Contracting Authority & Signature Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines who is legally permitted to bind the platform, its entities, and counterparties through contracts, agreements, and acceptances.

Its objectives are to:

• Eliminate unauthorised contractual commitments
• Prevent accidental or implied authority
• Ensure contracts are enforceable and auditable
• Align system actions with legal authority
• Protect directors, officers, and the platform from ultra vires acts

No contract—human or automated—may exist without compliance with this governance.

2. Governing Principles

Contracting authority is governed by the following principles:

• Authority must be explicit and documented
• Authority is role-based, not convenience-based
• Automation does not create authority
• UI actions do not imply legal power
• Signature ≠ authority unless expressly granted

Accordingly, contracts formed outside this framework are invalid by design.

3. Scope of Contracting Activity

This governance applies to all contractual instruments, including:

• Buyer terms and conditions
• Supplier agreements
• Service partner agreements
• Payment provider agreements
• Logistics and freight agreements
• IP licences
• Automated click-wrap and browse-wrap acceptances
• System-generated confirmations with legal effect

4. Authorised Contracting Entities

Only the following entity roles may legally contract:

Designated Contracting Entity (primary counterparty)

IP Ownership Entity (licensing only)

Payments & Funds Flow Entity (provider agreements only)

No other entity may contract unless expressly approved and documented.

5. Contracting Authority Allocation
5.1 Board-Level Authority

The Board (or equivalent governing body) retains exclusive authority over:

• Platform constitutional documents
• IP licensing agreements
• Material supplier framework agreements
• Strategic partnerships
• Amendments affecting liability exposure

These actions require formal resolution.

5.2 Executive Authority

Executives (as formally appointed) may contract only within:

• Approved monetary thresholds
• Pre-approved contract templates
• Defined categories of agreement

Authority is limited, revocable, and auditable.

5.3 Operational Authority

Operational staff do not possess inherent contracting authority.

They may:

• Initiate workflows
• Prepare documents
• Manage onboarding processes

They may not:

• Bind the entity
• Modify legal terms
• Override approvals

6. Automated Contract Formation

Automated contracts (e.g. click-wrap) are permitted only where:

• Contracting entity is pre-defined
• Terms are legally approved
• Acceptance is logged and hashed
• User identity is verified
• Jurisdiction is declared

Automation executes authority; it does not create it.

7. Signature Governance
7.1 Permitted Signature Methods

Only the following are valid:

• Wet ink (where required)
• Approved digital signature providers
• Cryptographically verifiable acceptance events

Email confirmation, UI clicks, or API calls are invalid unless governed.

7.2 Signature Attribution

Every signature must record:

• Signatory identity
• Authority source
• Entity represented
• Timestamp
• Jurisdiction

Unsigned or mis-attributed agreements are void.

8. Prohibited Contracting Actions

The following are explicitly prohibited:

• Admin users signing contracts by role alone
• Developers hardcoding acceptance logic
• Support staff committing the entity
• Suppliers modifying platform terms
• Buyers negotiating outside governed workflows

9. System Enforcement Requirements

The platform must enforce:

• Role-based contract execution gates
• Authority checks before acceptance
• Immutable contract records
• Audit logging of all acceptances
• Revocation handling

Any system path that bypasses enforcement is a critical defect.

10. Liability Containment

Where authority is exceeded:

• The action is unauthorised
• The individual bears personal responsibility
• The platform must detect and flag the breach
• Incident escalation is mandatory

11. Change Control

Any change to contracting authority requires:

• Legal review
• Risk impact analysis
• Board or delegated approval
• Versioned update to this document
