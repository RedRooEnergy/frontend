06.01 — Marketplace Business Rules & Commercial Model
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative commercial rulebook governing how the marketplace creates value, charges fees, enforces fairness, and protects financial integrity.

Commercial behaviour is system-enforced, not discretionary.

2. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Buyer transactions
• Supplier participation
• Service partner involvement
• Pricing construction
• Fees, margins, and incentives
• Catalogue monetisation
• Settlement preconditions

No revenue-generating activity is out of scope.

3. Commercial Governance Principles

The platform enforces the following principles:

• Commercial rules must be explicit and enforceable
• Pricing integrity overrides growth incentives
• Margin protection is mandatory
• No hidden fees or undisclosed incentives
• No retroactive commercial changes

Convenience must never override correctness.

4. Marketplace Value Exchange

The marketplace operates as a governed intermediary providing:

• Verified supplier access
• Compliance enforcement
• Pricing integrity
• Secure payments and escrow
• Logistics and customs handling
• Audit-ready records

All fees must correspond to delivered value.

5. Revenue Streams

Permitted revenue streams include:

• Buyer service fees
• Supplier participation or listing fees
• Catalogue monetisation fees
• Promotion and visibility fees
• Service partner programme fees

Any new revenue stream requires governance approval.

6. Fee Transparency Rules

All fees must be:

• Explicitly disclosed
• Deterministically calculable
• Auditable post-transaction
• Non-retroactive

Hidden or implicit fees are prohibited.

7. Buyer Charges

Buyer-facing charges may include:

• Product price
• Shipping and customs (DDP)
• Buyer service fee (if applicable)
• Applicable taxes

Buyer charges must reflect the locked pricing snapshot.

8. Supplier Charges

Supplier charges may include:

• Transaction fees
• Catalogue placement fees
• Promotion fees
• Service programme fees

Supplier charges must not violate margin floors.

8.1 Marketplace Service Charge Ledger (1%)

The marketplace records immutable 1% service charge events in the platform fee ledger only.

These are recorded as governance artefacts (not payouts) and apply to:

• Suppliers — 1% on certification completion per product (CERTIFIED/PASSED)
• Compliance/Certification partners — 1% on product listing approval where they are certifier of record
• Installers — 1% on purchase orders attributed to the RRE installer channel

Important boundary:
• Service Partner domain remains payment-free
• No escrow, payouts, settlement, invoices, or balances for service partners
• All service payments occur off-platform

9. Margin Floor Doctrine

The platform enforces minimum margin floors to:

• Protect marketplace sustainability
• Prevent predatory pricing
• Ensure service obligations can be met

Orders violating margin floors are blocked.

10. Incentives & Discounts

Incentives may include:

• Volume discounts
• Promotional discounts
• Buyer incentives

All incentives must:

• Respect margin floors
• Be applied deterministically
• Be reflected in pricing snapshots

Stacking rules must be explicit.

11. Catalogue Monetisation

Catalogue visibility and placement may be monetised subject to:

• Tier rules
• Exclusivity constraints
• Weekly lock cycles
• Auditability

Visibility must never bypass compliance.

12. Negotiated Transactions

Large or complex orders may require:

• Negotiated pricing workflows
• Pre-approval
• Locked commercial terms
• Explicit acceptance

Negotiated terms remain immutable once accepted.

13. Settlement Preconditions

No funds may be settled unless:

• Pricing snapshot is locked
• Compliance state is valid
• Delivery conditions are satisfied
• Dispute windows are respected

Settlement logic is non-bypassable.

14. Dispute & Refund Impact

Commercial rules must integrate with:

• Refund policies
• Chargeback handling
• Dispute resolution

Financial reversals must be auditable.

15. Audit & Evidence

The platform must be able to demonstrate:

• Fee calculation logic
• Margin enforcement
• Incentive application
• Settlement decisions

Commercial decisions are legal artefacts.

16. Change Control

Changes to commercial rules require:

• Risk assessment
• Legal review
• Governance approval
• Versioned documentation updates

Retroactive changes are prohibited.

17. Enforcement Rules

• No transaction without a pricing snapshot
• No discount violating margin floors
• No undisclosed fees
• No manual overrides

Violations block system progression.
