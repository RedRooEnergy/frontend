12.01 — Payments, Escrow & Settlement Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the non-negotiable governance framework governing all monetary flows within the marketplace, including payments, escrow holding, settlement, refunds, and dispute interaction.

Its purpose is to ensure that no funds can move without commercial integrity, compliance confirmation, and audit traceability.

2. Governing Principle

Money moves only when the system proves it is allowed to move.

Payments are never discretionary, never manual, and never trust-based.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Buyer payments
• Escrow holding mechanisms
• Supplier settlement
• Refunds and reversals
• Dispute-linked payment holds
• Multi-party payment splits

Out of scope:

• External accounting systems
• Tax authority remittance systems (handled downstream)

4. Payment Architecture Model

The marketplace operates a controlled escrow-based model, not a direct pass-through payment system.

Key characteristics:

• Funds are captured from buyers
• Funds are held in escrow
• Funds are released only after governance conditions are met

5. System of Record

The platform is the sole system of record for:

• Payment intent creation
• Escrow state
• Settlement eligibility

External payment providers are execution agents only.

6. Pricing Snapshot Enforcement

At checkout:

• A pricing snapshot is generated
• Snapshot includes all line items, fees, taxes, duties, and discounts
• Snapshot is immutable once payment intent is created

No post-payment repricing is permitted.

7. Escrow Creation Rules

Escrow is created automatically when:

• Payment intent is confirmed
• Pricing snapshot is validated
• Buyer funds are successfully captured

Escrow creation cannot be bypassed.

8. Escrow Hold Conditions

Escrow remains locked until all required conditions are met:

• Product compliance confirmed
• Shipment dispatched
• Delivery confirmed
• No unresolved disputes

Failure of any condition blocks release.

9. Settlement Eligibility Rules

Settlement to suppliers requires:

• Valid delivery confirmation
• No open shipping failure cases
• No compliance revocation
• No payment disputes

All conditions must be met simultaneously.

10. Settlement Execution

When eligible:

• Settlement is triggered automatically
• Supplier receives net amount after fees
• Marketplace fees are retained

Manual settlement is prohibited.

11. Split Payments

For multi-supplier orders:

• Escrow is logically segmented
• Settlement is evaluated per supplier
• Failure for one supplier does not release others

Splits must preserve audit linkage.

12. Refund Governance

Refunds may occur only when:

• Escrow funds are still held
• Resolution outcome authorises refund
• Refund amount matches snapshot rules

Partial refunds must be justified.

13. Chargebacks & Disputes

When a dispute is raised:

• Escrow is immediately frozen
• Settlement is suspended
• Evidence pack is generated

External dispute outcomes are reconciled back to system records.

14. Currency Handling

All payments must:

• Use governed currency mappings
• Preserve original transaction currency
• Record FX conversions explicitly

Hidden conversions are prohibited.

15. Audit Logging

All payment events must generate:

• Timestamped records
• Actor attribution
• Immutable state transitions

Logs must be non-editable.

16. Fraud & Abuse Controls

The system must enforce:

• Duplicate payment prevention
• Re-use detection
• Velocity limits

Fraud detection does not override governance rules.

17. Failure Handling

Payment failures must:

• Be classified
• Generate retry eligibility rules
• Never create orphan escrow states

18. Reporting & Reconciliation

The platform must support:

• Escrow balance reporting
• Settlement history
• Fee reconciliation

Reports must reconcile exactly to ledger data.

19. Change Control

Any modification to:

• Escrow rules
• Settlement logic
• Pricing snapshot structure

Requires formal change control approval.
