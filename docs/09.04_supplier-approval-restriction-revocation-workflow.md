09.04 — Supplier Approval, Restriction & Revocation Workflow
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative lifecycle workflow governing supplier approval, restriction, and revocation. It establishes how a supplier transitions from verified candidate to active participant, and how access is constrained or withdrawn when governance conditions are breached.

Supplier status is a governed system state, not an administrative preference.

2. Governance Doctrine

Supplier capability exists only while governance conditions remain satisfied.

The platform must ensure that:

• Approval is explicit and auditable
• Capability is proportional to compliance state
• Restrictions are enforceable and immediate
• Revocation is decisive, non-destructive, and irreversible without re-onboarding

No implicit approval or silent continuation is permitted.

3. Scope

This document governs:

• Supplier approval decisions
• Activation of supplier capabilities
• Temporary restrictions and suspensions
• Full supplier revocation
• Cross-extension enforcement of supplier state

Out of scope:

• Identity verification (09.02)
• Certification validation (09.03)
• Product governance (Phase 10)

4. Canonical Supplier States

The system must support the following canonical states:

• Draft — Incomplete or unsubmitted onboarding
• Submitted — Awaiting review
• Approved — Fully verified and permitted to operate
• Restricted — Temporarily limited capability
• Revoked — Permanently prohibited from operating

States are mutually exclusive and explicitly transitioned.

5. Approval Preconditions

A supplier may only be Approved if:

• Legal identity verification state = Verified
• Mandatory certifications = Valid
• Jurisdictional eligibility = Confirmed
• No unresolved governance flags exist

Failure of any precondition blocks approval.

6. Approval Authority & Controls

Approval decisions:

• Are role-restricted
• Require documented justification
• Are executed via governed workflows
• Are immutable once recorded

Only explicitly authorised roles may approve suppliers. UI-only controls are prohibited.

7. Activation Semantics

Upon approval:

• Supplier capabilities are enabled across all extensions
• Product submission becomes available
• Catalogue eligibility is unlocked
• Audit state is marked “Active”

Activation is atomic and governed.

8. Restriction Doctrine

A Restriction is a temporary, reversible limitation imposed when governance conditions degrade but do not yet warrant revocation.

Triggers include:

• Expired certifications
• Pending re-verification
• Investigation in progress
• Minor governance breaches

Restrictions must be explicit and scoped.

9. Restriction Effects

While Restricted, a supplier may experience:

• Blocked product submission
• Suspended catalogue visibility
• Frozen payments or settlements
• Limited dashboard access

Existing orders follow governed exception paths.

10. Restriction Authority

Restrictions:

• May be applied automatically by system rules
• May be applied manually by authorised roles
• Must include justification and duration

All restrictions are auditable and time-bound.

11. Revocation Doctrine

Revocation is a permanent removal of supplier capability.

Triggers include:

• Fraud or misrepresentation
• Regulatory breach
• Sanctions violations
• Repeated governance failures

Revocation is decisive and immediate.

12. Revocation Effects

Upon revocation:

• All supplier capabilities are disabled
• New transactions are prohibited
• Catalogue visibility is removed
• Historical data remains immutable

Revocation does not delete records.

13. Reinstatement Rules

Revoked suppliers:

• Cannot be reinstated automatically
• Must undergo full re-onboarding
• Receive a new supplier record

Historical records remain linked for audit.

14. Cross-Extension Enforcement

Supplier state must be enforced by:

• Product & Catalogue Extension
• Payments & Settlement Extension
• Logistics & Shipping Extension
• Buyer Experience Extension

No extension may ignore supplier state.

15. Audit & Evidence Requirements

Every state transition must log:

• Previous state
• New state
• Actor identity
• Governing artefacts referenced
• Justification
• Timestamp

Logs are immutable and regulator-exportable.

16. Automation Rules

Automated transitions may occur only when:

• Explicitly defined in governance documents
• Deterministic and auditable
• Non-destructive

Silent automation is prohibited.

17. Abuse & Escalation

The system must detect:

• Repeated restriction cycles
• Patterned compliance failures
• Attempted circumvention

Escalations follow incident governance rules.

18. Non-Functional Guarantees

Supplier lifecycle governance prioritises:

• Correctness over speed
• Enforcement over convenience
• Auditability over flexibility
