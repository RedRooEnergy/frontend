07.02 — Identity, Authentication & Role Enforcement

Version: v0.2 DRAFT
Phase: 7 — Core Data Models & Immutability
Upstream Dependencies: 07.01 — Core Data Models & Immutability Specification
Downstream Dependencies: 07.03 — Audit Logging & Immutability
Status: DRAFT (Lock-Ready)

1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative Core rules for identity management, authentication, and role-based access control (RBAC) within the Immutable Core.

Identity and role enforcement are non-optional system guarantees and form part of the platform’s governance boundary.

2. Governing Principle

Authority flows from identity.
Access flows from role.
Everything else is denied.

No operation may be performed without authenticated identity and explicitly granted authority.

3. Identity Enforcement

• All actors interacting with the platform must be represented by a Core Identity record
• Identity records are immutable
• Authentication state is derived from validated identity only

Unauthenticated or unverifiable actors are rejected.

4. Role Enforcement

Role assignment governs:
• Permitted actions
• Permitted scope
• Permitted authority

Role evaluation occurs before execution of any Core-governed operation.

5. Closed Role Set (Core) — 07.02.X

The Immutable Core recognises the following closed set of roles:

• Buyer
• Supplier
• Administrator
• Compliance Authority
• System (non-human)

No additional roles may be introduced at Core level.

Extensions may introduce scoped permissions only, provided they do not:
• Expand Core authority
• Introduce new Core-level roles
• Bypass or override Core role semantics

6. Default Deny Principle — 07.02.Y

The Core platform enforces a default-deny security model.

Any action, access, or operation not explicitly permitted by Core role definitions is denied by default.

Absence of permission is interpreted as denial, not ambiguity.

7. Non-Bypassability — 07.02.Z

Identity, authentication, and role enforcement defined in the Immutable Core cannot be bypassed, overridden, relaxed, or conditionally disabled by:

• Configuration
• Extensions
• Operational procedures
• Administrative action

Any mechanism attempting to circumvent Core enforcement is invalid and must be blocked.
