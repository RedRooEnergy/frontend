15.03 — Financial Oversight Dashboard Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance rules for the Financial Oversight Dashboard, whose function is to provide authoritative, audit-grade visibility into all financial flows across the marketplace.

This dashboard exists to observe, reconcile, and evidence financial activity — not to initiate, alter, or override it.

2. Governing Principle

Money moves by system rule.
Oversight confirms correctness, not intent.

No human interface may influence settlement outcomes.

3. Scope

Applies to dashboards accessed by:

• Finance Officers
• Financial Controllers
• Auditors
• Executive Oversight (read-only)

Covers visibility into:

• Buyer payments
• Escrow balances
• Supplier settlements
• Refunds and reversals
• Fees, margins, and taxes

4. Role-Based Access Control

Defined roles:

• Finance Officer — full oversight, reconciliation, escalation
• Controller — read-only + export
• Auditor — read-only + evidence export
• Admin — restricted, non-operational visibility

No role grants payment execution capability.

5. Read-Only Enforcement

The Financial Oversight Dashboard must be strictly non-mutative.

It must not permit:

• Manual payment release
• Settlement adjustment
• Refund initiation
• Escrow override

All financial actions occur only via governed workflows.

6. Financial Domains Displayed

The dashboard must surface:

• Payment provider transactions
• Pricing snapshot references
• Escrow state per order
• Settlement lifecycle states
• Fee allocations
• GST and tax components

Each domain is independently auditable.

7. Pricing Snapshot Integrity

Every financial record must link to:

• Pricing Snapshot ID
• Snapshot hash
• Generation timestamp
• Verification status

Financial data without a verified snapshot is invalid.

8. Escrow Lifecycle Visibility

The dashboard must show:

• Funds received
• Escrow hold status
• Release conditions
• Partial releases
• Failed or reversed settlements

Escrow events are immutable.

9. Settlement Transparency

For each settlement:

• Beneficiary entity
• Amount
• Currency
• Trigger condition
• Execution timestamp
• Provider confirmation

No aggregated or inferred values permitted.

10. Refund & Dispute Visibility

The dashboard must surface:

• Refund requests
• Dispute states
• Chargebacks
• Resolution outcomes

Refunds cannot be created or approved here.

11. Fee & Margin Visibility

The dashboard must clearly display:

• Marketplace fees
• Supplier fees
• Promotions impact
• Margin floors applied

Margin violations must be visible and non-editable.

12. Tax & GST Handling

Financial views must include:

• GST components
• Jurisdiction mapping
• Tax calculation basis

Tax data must align with regulator-ready exports.

13. Cross-Linking Rules

Financial records must link to:

• Orders
• Suppliers
• Buyers (masked)
• Audit logs
• Compliance states

Links are navigational only.

14. Alerts & Thresholds

The dashboard may display alerts for:

• Failed payments
• Escrow delays
• Settlement mismatches
• Margin breaches

Alerts do not permit corrective action.

15. Escalation Controls

Permitted actions:

• Flag financial anomaly
• Trigger investigation case
• Request reconciliation

Each action is logged and non-financial.

16. Export & Audit Support

The dashboard must support:

• Financial evidence packs
• Transaction exports
• Reconciliation reports

Exports must be reproducible and hash-verifiable.

17. Audit Logging

All dashboard access must log:

• User identity
• Role
• Records viewed
• Export actions
• Timestamp

Financial oversight access is auditable.

18. Security Controls

The dashboard must enforce:

• Strong authentication
• Least-privilege access
• Session timeouts
• IP and device logging

Any anomaly is a security incident.

19. Failure Behaviour

On system failure:

• Dashboard must fail closed
• No partial financial states shown
• No cached values displayed

Financial truth must remain authoritative.

20. Change Control

Changes affecting:

• Financial visibility
• Calculations
• Export formats

Require formal change control approval.

21. Non-Bypass Rule

The Financial Oversight Dashboard:

• Cannot release funds
• Cannot alter balances
• Cannot override escrow
• Cannot bypass pricing snapshots

Oversight does not equal authority.
