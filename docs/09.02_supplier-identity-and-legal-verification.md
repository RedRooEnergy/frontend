09.02 — Supplier Identity & Legal Verification
1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory identity and legal verification requirements for suppliers entering the marketplace. It ensures that every supplier is a real, legally constituted entity with verified authority to transact, prior to any compliance review, product submission, or commercial activity.

Identity verification is a precondition, not a step in a checklist.

2. Verification Doctrine

No legal identity. No authority. No supplier.

The system must guarantee that:

• Every supplier maps to a verifiable legal entity
• Acting users have documented authority
• Jurisdictional eligibility is established
• All evidence is immutable and auditable

Provisional or “best-effort” verification is prohibited.

3. Scope

This document governs:

• Supplier legal identity intake
• Corporate existence verification
• Beneficial ownership declaration
• Authorized signatory validation
• Jurisdictional eligibility checks

Out of scope:

• Product certifications (covered in 09.03)
• Commercial terms (covered in Phase 6)
• Payments and settlement (Phase 12)

4. Supplier Legal Entity Requirements

Each supplier must submit evidence of:

• Legal entity name (exact, registered)
• Registration number
• Jurisdiction of incorporation
• Registered address
• Operating address (if different)
• Entity type (company, partnership, etc.)

All fields are mandatory.

5. Acceptable Evidence Types

Accepted legal evidence includes:

• Government-issued business registration certificates
• Official corporate registry extracts
• Certificates of incorporation
• Equivalent jurisdictional documents

Self-declared documents are prohibited.

6. Jurisdictional Eligibility Rules

The platform must evaluate:

• Whether the supplier’s jurisdiction is permitted
• Sanctions or trade restrictions
• Regulatory compatibility with target markets

Ineligible jurisdictions result in immediate rejection.

7. Authorized Representative Verification

At least one Authorized Representative must be verified.

Requirements:

• Natural person identity verification
• Proof of authority to bind the entity
• Role and title confirmation

Accepted authority evidence includes:

• Board resolutions
• Power of attorney
• Officer appointment records

8. Beneficial Ownership Declaration

Suppliers must declare:

• Ultimate beneficial owners (as defined by law)
• Ownership percentages
• Control relationships

False declarations constitute grounds for revocation.

9. Verification States

Legal identity verification states:

• Pending
• Verified
• Failed
• Expired

Only Verified suppliers may proceed to compliance validation.

10. Validation Workflow

Supplier submits identity dossier

System validates document completeness

Reviewer verifies authenticity

Jurisdictional eligibility evaluated

Verification decision recorded

Each step is governed and audited.

11. Evidence Handling & Immutability

All identity documents:

• Are stored in the DMS
• Are versioned
• Are hash-verified
• Cannot be deleted or overwritten

Superseded documents remain retained.

12. Re-Verification & Expiry

Identity verification must:

• Support periodic re-validation
• Expire based on jurisdictional rules
• Trigger restriction if expired

Expired verification suspends supplier activity.

13. Audit & Logging

Every verification action logs:

• Actor identity
• Evidence referenced
• Decision outcome
• Justification
• Timestamp

Logs are immutable and regulator-exportable.

14. Abuse & Fraud Handling

The system must detect:

• Forged or altered documents
• Identity mismatches
• Repeated failed attempts
• Cross-supplier identity reuse

Findings escalate under incident governance.

15. Role & Authority Constraints

Only roles explicitly granted:

• SUPPLIER_VERIFIER
• LEGAL_REVIEWER

may approve or reject identity verification.

UI-only restrictions are prohibited.

16. Extension Interaction Rules

Downstream extensions may:

• Query identity verification state

They may not:

• Modify verification records
• Override failed decisions

Identity authority remains with this extension.
