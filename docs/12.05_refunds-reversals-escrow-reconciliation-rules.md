12.05 — Refunds, Reversals & Escrow Reconciliation Rules
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative rules for handling refunds, payment reversals, and escrow reconciliation across all payment providers.

Its objective is to ensure that money movement remains correct, auditable, regulator-safe, and immune to double-spend or accounting drift, even under dispute, failure, or partial fulfilment scenarios.

2. Governing Principle

Refunds correct outcomes.
Reconciliation proves correctness.

No refund, reversal, or adjustment may occur without a traceable causal event and verifiable linkage to escrow and pricing snapshots.

3. Scope

This doctrine governs:

• Buyer refunds
• Supplier clawbacks
• Partial refunds
• Payment reversals
• Chargeback handling
• Escrow reconciliation
• Ledger correction

Out of scope:

• Provider-specific UI flows
• Banking institution internal processes

4. Definitions

Refund
A system-authorised return of funds to the buyer after settlement or partial settlement.

Reversal
A payment provider–initiated rollback of a transaction (e.g. chargeback, failed capture).

Reconciliation
The process of aligning escrow state, ledger entries, and provider balances to prove correctness.

5. Refund Preconditions

A refund may only be initiated if:

• A valid order exists
• The refund reason is classified
• Escrow or settlement state permits refund
• Refund amount does not exceed authorised limits

Unclassified refunds are prohibited.

6. Refund Classification

All refunds must be classified as one of:

• Buyer return (governed RMA)
• Non-delivery
• Partial fulfilment
• Compliance failure
• Supplier fault
• Regulatory intervention
• System error correction

Classification is immutable once recorded.

7. Refund Source Hierarchy

Refund source must be determined in the following order:

Held escrow funds

Unreleased settlement balances

Supplier clawback

Marketplace liability account

The system must never refund from an incorrect source.

8. Partial Refund Rules

Partial refunds are permitted only when:

• Pricing snapshot supports itemised allocation
• Delivered vs undelivered components are proven
• Compliance state is known per component

Rounding must follow deterministic rules.

9. Supplier Clawback Rules

Supplier clawbacks may occur only if:

• Funds have already been settled
• Supplier fault or compliance breach is confirmed
• Clawback authority exists contractually

Clawbacks must be fully auditable.

10. Reversal & Chargeback Handling

If a payment provider triggers a reversal:

• Escrow state is frozen
• Dispute workflow is opened
• Funds movement is halted
• Reconciliation is mandatory

Provider actions do not override governance rules.

11. Escrow Reconciliation Requirements

For every refund or reversal, the system must reconcile:

• Escrow balance
• Settlement ledger entries
• Provider transaction records
• Snapshot pricing references

Reconciliation failures block further actions.

12. Ledger Integrity Rules

The financial ledger must:

• Record all adjustments as append-only entries
• Never delete or overwrite records
• Preserve original transaction context

Corrections are additive, never destructive.

13. Timing & Settlement Windows

Refund timing must respect:

• Provider processing windows
• Regulatory cooling-off periods
• Contractual settlement cutoffs

Early or late refunds require justification.

14. Failure Handling

If refund or reversal execution fails:

• Funds remain locked
• Incident workflow is triggered
• Manual intervention requires evidence
• Retry logic is controlled and logged

Silent retries are prohibited.

15. Audit & Evidence Requirements

Each refund or reversal must generate:

• Refund classification record
• Causal event linkage
• Escrow and ledger delta
• Provider confirmation evidence

Records must be regulator-exportable.

16. Abuse & Fraud Prevention

The system must prevent:

• Duplicate refunds
• Refund amount inflation
• Unauthorised manual refunds
• Provider-only refund triggers

Governance enforcement is mandatory.

17. Change Control

Any change to:

• Refund logic
• Reconciliation rules
• Ledger handling

Requires formal governance approval.

18. Enforcement Status

This doctrine is:

• Mandatory
• Runtime-enforced
• Audit-locked

No administrative override is permitted.
