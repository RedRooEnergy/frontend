03.03 — Inter-Entity Responsibility & Authority Mapping
1. Purpose

This document defines the explicit allocation of responsibilities, authorities, and liabilities across all legal entities involved in the marketplace platform.

Its objectives are to ensure:

• No overlapping or ambiguous authority
• Clear accountability for every system action
• Controlled delegation of power
• Defensible liability boundaries
• Regulator- and court-ready clarity

Every operational, contractual, and technical action performed by the platform must map to one and only one legally accountable entity.

2. Governing Principles

Inter-entity governance is governed by the following principles:

• Authority must be explicit, never implied
• Responsibility must be singular, not shared
• Delegation does not transfer liability unless stated
• No entity may act outside its defined mandate
• Legal clarity precedes system capability

Accordingly, ambiguity is treated as a governance failure.

3. Defined Entity Set

This mapping applies to the following entity roles (as defined in 03.01):

IP Ownership Entity

Marketplace Operator

Contracting Entity (Buyers & Suppliers)

Payments & Funds Flow Entity

Service / Support Entity (if applicable)

If any role is consolidated into a single entity, that consolidation must be explicitly documented.

4. Responsibility vs Authority vs Liability

For clarity, the following distinctions apply:

• Responsibility — Who performs the action
• Authority — Who is permitted to decide or execute
• Liability — Who bears legal consequence

These dimensions must be independently assigned and documented.

6. Prohibited Authority Overlap

The following overlaps are explicitly prohibited:

• Payments Entity altering compliance states
• Support Entity overriding contracts
• Suppliers exercising platform authority
• Admin users bypassing legal boundaries

Overlap constitutes a governance breach.

7. Delegation Rules

Where authority is delegated:

• Delegation must be documented
• Scope must be limited
• Delegation does not remove liability
• Delegation must be revocable

Implicit delegation is invalid.

8. System Mapping Requirement

Every system capability must declare:

• Responsible entity
• Authorising entity
• Liable entity

Capabilities without mapping are prohibited from being built.

9. Enforcement

Violations include:

• Actions without mapped authority
• Shared responsibility assignments
• Informal delegation
• UI behaviour inconsistent with authority mapping

Violations must be escalated and recorded.

10. Change Control

Any change to inter-entity mapping requires:

• Legal review
• Risk assessment
• Contract impact analysis
• Governing authority approval
