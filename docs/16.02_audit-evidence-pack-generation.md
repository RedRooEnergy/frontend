16.02 — Audit Evidence Pack Generation
1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory framework for generating Audit Evidence Packs. Evidence Packs are structured, immutable collections of system artefacts produced to support audits, investigations, disputes, regulatory reviews, and litigation readiness.

They are not reports. They are forensic evidence bundles.

2. Governing Principle

Evidence must be complete, immutable, and independently verifiable.

An Evidence Pack must stand on its own, without explanation, interpretation, or manual supplementation.

3. Scope

This governance applies to Evidence Packs generated for:

• Regulatory audits
• Financial audits
• Compliance inspections
• Incident investigations
• Dispute resolution
• Litigation support
• Insurance claims

4. Definition of an Evidence Pack

An Evidence Pack is a sealed, versioned archive containing:

• Source records
• Supporting artefacts
• Audit trails
• Integrity proofs

All contents are immutable at generation.

5. Trigger Events

Evidence Packs may be generated only when triggered by:

• Regulator request
• Formal audit notice
• Incident escalation
• Dispute initiation
• Legal counsel request
• Internal governance review

Ad-hoc or exploratory generation is prohibited.

6. Authoritative Inputs

Evidence Packs must be built exclusively from:

• Immutable database records
• Audit logs
• Versioned documents
• Pricing snapshots
• Compliance artefacts
• System state metadata

External or reconstructed data is prohibited.

7. Pack Composition (Mandatory Sections)

Each Evidence Pack must include:

Manifest File
• Pack ID
• Purpose
• Trigger event
• Scope definition

Artefact Index
• Full listing of included items
• Source identifiers

Primary Records
• Orders
• Payments
• Compliance records
• Documents

Audit Logs
• Access logs
• Change logs
• System events

Integrity Proofs
• Hashes
• Signatures
• Verification metadata

8. Deterministic Assembly

Evidence Pack generation must be:

• Deterministic
• Scripted
• Reproducible

Running the same generation with the same parameters must produce identical output hashes.

9. Hashing & Sealing

Upon generation:

• Each artefact is hashed
• The full pack is hashed
• Hashes are recorded in the audit log

Any post-generation change invalidates the pack.

10. Timestamping

Each pack must include:

• Generation timestamp
• System time reference
• Timezone normalisation

Time ambiguity is prohibited.

11. Schema & Version Anchoring

Evidence Packs must declare:

• Data schema versions
• Document versions
• Generator version

This ensures long-term interpretability.

12. Access Control

Only authorised roles may:

• Initiate pack generation
• Approve release
• Access sealed packs

All access is logged.

13. Redaction Rules

Redaction:

• Must be rule-based
• Must be logged
• Must preserve integrity proofs

Manual redaction is prohibited.

14. Export Formats

Permitted formats:

• Encrypted ZIP (default)
• WORM-compatible archive
• Physical media (where mandated)

Formats must preserve file integrity.

15. Chain of Custody

Evidence Packs must include a Chain of Custody Log recording:

• Who generated the pack
• Who accessed it
• Who released it
• How it was transferred

Chain integrity must be unbroken.

16. Delivery Controls

Delivery methods must be:

• Secure
• Logged
• Verifiable

Email delivery is prohibited unless explicitly mandated.

17. Retention & Legal Hold

Evidence Packs are subject to:

• Extended retention
• Automatic legal hold
• Deletion prohibition

They may not be altered or destroyed without legal clearance.

18. Failure Handling

If pack generation fails:

• Partial packs must be discarded
• Failure logged
• Regeneration traceable

Silent or partial output is prohibited.

19. Non-Interpretation Rule

Evidence Packs:

• Contain facts only
• No summaries
• No opinions
• No conclusions

Interpretation occurs externally.
