13.05 — Buyer Returns, Refund Requests & Post-Order Actions Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance rules for all buyer-initiated actions after order commitment, including returns, refund requests, issue reporting, and post-order communications.

Its purpose is to ensure that buyer actions are governed requests, not direct state mutations, and that all post-order outcomes remain compliant, auditable, and contractually correct.

2. Governing Principle

Buyers may request outcomes.
The system determines outcomes.

No buyer-initiated action may directly alter financial, fulfilment, or compliance state without governed validation.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Return requests (RMA initiation)
• Refund requests
• Delivery issue reporting
• Damage or defect claims
• Order-related support requests
• Buyer acknowledgements and confirmations

Out of scope:

• Supplier internal remediation workflows
• Off-platform communications

4. Buyer-Initiated Action Classification

All buyer actions must be classified as one of:

• Return request (RMA)
• Refund request (non-return)
• Delivery issue
• Damage or defect claim
• Missing documentation
• General order inquiry

Unclassified actions are rejected.

5. Eligibility Rules

A buyer may initiate an action only if:

• The order exists and is committed
• The buyer is the original purchaser
• The action falls within permitted time windows
• The order state permits the action

Eligibility checks are mandatory.

6. Return (RMA) Governance

Returns may be requested only when:

• Product category permits returns
• Return window is open
• Compliance state allows return
• Product condition requirements are met

RMA approval is not automatic.

7. Refund Request Governance

Refund requests may be submitted:

• With or without physical return, depending on classification
• Only within governed refund windows
• Only up to authorised refundable amounts

Requested refund ≠ approved refund.

8. Evidence Requirements

Buyer-initiated actions may require:

• Photographic evidence
• Delivery confirmation data
• Serial numbers or identifiers
• Written explanation

Evidence becomes part of the immutable case record.

9. Action Submission Process

When a buyer submits an action:

• A governed case record is created
• The action is timestamped
• Supporting evidence is locked
• No immediate financial changes occur

Submission does not imply approval.

10. Case Routing & Escalation

Cases must be routed based on:

• Action classification
• Supplier involvement
• Compliance implications
• Financial exposure

Escalation thresholds are predefined.

11. Interaction with Escrow & Settlement

Buyer actions may affect:

• Escrow holds
• Settlement timing
• Refund eligibility

However, no funds move without passing refund and reconciliation governance.

12. Buyer Communications

Buyer communications regarding actions must:

• Reflect factual status only
• Avoid promises or timelines not system-approved
• Reference case and order identifiers

Communications are logged immutably.

13. Supplier Interaction Boundaries

Buyers may not:

• Negotiate directly with suppliers outside the platform
• Receive off-platform compensation
• Bypass governed workflows

All interactions are mediated.

14. Time Windows & Cutoffs

Post-order actions must respect:

• Statutory cooling-off periods
• Contractual return windows
• Regulatory deadlines

Late requests require explicit rejection or exception handling.

15. Abuse & Fraud Prevention

The system must detect and prevent:

• Repeated abusive refund requests
• Evidence reuse across cases
• Refund amount inflation
• Policy gaming

Abuse signals are logged and auditable.

16. Resolution Outcomes

Possible governed outcomes include:

• Return approved
• Refund approved (full or partial)
• Replacement authorised
• Claim rejected
• Escalation to dispute

Outcomes are immutable once finalised.

17. Audit & Evidence

Each post-order action must generate:

• Case lifecycle events
• Decision records
• Evidence hashes
• Financial impact traceability

Cases are regulator-exportable.

18. Change Control

Any change affecting:

• Buyer action eligibility
• Return or refund logic
• Case workflows

Requires formal governance approval.

19. Enforcement Status

This governance is:

• Mandatory
• Runtime-enforced
• Non-bypassable

Manual overrides are prohibited.
