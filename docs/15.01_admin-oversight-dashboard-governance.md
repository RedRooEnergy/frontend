15.01 — Admin Oversight Dashboard Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance framework for all administrative and oversight dashboards within the platform. These dashboards exist to observe, supervise, and evidence system behaviour, not to operate, shortcut, or override governed workflows.

Administrative visibility must never weaken enforcement.

2. Governing Principle

Admins supervise outcomes.
Systems enforce rules.

Dashboards must reflect authoritative system truth and preserve auditability at all times.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Platform administration dashboards
• Compliance oversight dashboards
• Payments and settlement monitoring
• Dispute and incident supervision
• Reporting and audit access panels

Out of scope:

• Operational tooling that performs actions on behalf of users
• Any UI that bypasses governed workflows

4. Role Separation

Admin roles must be explicitly separated:

• Platform Administrator
• Compliance Officer
• Finance & Settlement Officer
• Risk & Incident Officer
• Read-Only Auditor

Roles are mutually constrained.

5. Read-Only by Default Rule

All dashboards are read-only by default.

Any permitted action must:

• Be explicitly defined
• Be role-scoped
• Require confirmation
• Generate audit records

Implicit authority is prohibited.

6. Prohibited Capabilities

Admin dashboards must not allow:

• Direct data mutation
• Payment release overrides
• Compliance bypass
• Forced state transitions
• Undocumented changes

If an action is not governed, it must not exist.

7. Permitted Action Categories

Only the following action classes may be allowed:

• Case escalation
• Approval acknowledgements
• Evidence review confirmations
• Change-control initiation
• Formal revocation triggers

Each action requires justification.

8. Evidence-First Display Model

Dashboards must surface:

• Source documents
• System-generated evidence
• Pricing snapshots
• Compliance states
• Timeline-ordered events

Summary views must link to raw evidence.

9. Temporal Integrity

All dashboard data must display:

• Timestamps
• Timezones
• Sequence ordering

No data may be presented without temporal context.

10. Cross-Domain Visibility Rules

Admins may view cross-domain data only if:

• Their role explicitly allows it
• The access is logged
• The data is read-only

Data leakage across domains is prohibited.

11. Audit Trail Enforcement

Every admin interaction must log:

• Identity
• Role
• Viewed artefact
• Action (if any)
• Timestamp

Viewing sensitive data is an auditable event.

12. Compliance Oversight Panels

Compliance dashboards must support:

• Supplier compliance status
• Certification validity
• Revocation history
• Regulatory mapping

No manual compliance overrides are allowed.

13. Financial Oversight Panels

Finance dashboards may display:

• Payment states
• Escrow balances
• Settlement readiness
• Refund progress

They must not execute financial actions directly.

14. Dispute & Incident Oversight

Dashboards must allow:

• Case monitoring
• Escalation tracking
• SLA breach identification
• Evidence review

Resolution actions remain governed elsewhere.

15. Alerting & Threshold Visibility

Admins must be able to see:

• Breached thresholds
• Risk flags
• Regulatory alerts

Dashboards display alerts; systems enforce responses.

16. Reporting & Export Controls

Admin dashboards may generate:

• Regulator exports
• Audit reports
• Oversight summaries

Exports must be reproducible and hash-verifiable.

17. Security Constraints

Admin dashboards must enforce:

• Strong authentication
• Role-based access
• Session timeouts
• View-level logging

Admin compromise is treated as a critical incident.

18. Change Control Integration

Any proposed dashboard change affecting:

• Visibility scope
• Action permissions
• Data aggregation

Requires formal change control approval.

19. Failure & Recovery Expectations

Dashboards must:

• Fail safely
• Never expose partial data
• Preserve audit continuity

UI failure must not affect backend enforcement.

20. Enforcement Status

This governance is:

• Mandatory
• Enforced by system design
• Not bypassable

Admin authority does not supersede governance.
