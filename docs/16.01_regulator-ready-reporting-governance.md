16.01 — Regulator-Ready Reporting Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance framework for regulator-ready reporting across the marketplace. Its objective is to ensure that all regulatory, statutory, and supervisory reports are accurate, reproducible, traceable, and audit-safe.

Reporting under this framework is not ad-hoc analytics; it is formal evidence production.

2. Governing Principle

Every report must be defensible as evidence.

Reports must withstand scrutiny from regulators, courts, insurers, and auditors without post-hoc interpretation or manual adjustment.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Regulatory submissions
• Statutory compliance reports
• Regulator-requested disclosures
• Supervisory audits
• Investigatory evidence exports

It applies regardless of jurisdiction, authority, or reporting frequency.

4. Authoritative Data Sources

All reports must be generated exclusively from:

• Locked system records
• Immutable audit logs
• Versioned compliance artefacts
• Verified pricing snapshots

Manual data entry, spreadsheet manipulation, or external data blending is prohibited.

5. Report Classification

All regulator-ready reports must be classified as one of:

• Statutory — legally mandated
• Supervisory — oversight or inspection
• Investigatory — incident or breach driven
• Periodic — scheduled compliance
• Ad-hoc — regulator-initiated request

Classification determines retention, approval, and disclosure rules.

6. Generation Rules

Reports must be:

• System-generated
• Deterministic
• Reproducible on demand
• Time-bounded

Running the same report with the same parameters must always produce the same output.

7. Time & State Anchoring

Each report must be anchored to:

• A defined time window
• A defined system state
• A defined schema version

Reports may not mix data across state changes or schema revisions.

8. Hashing & Integrity

Every generated report must include:

• Content hash (SHA-256 or stronger)
• Generation timestamp
• Generator version
• Source dataset identifiers

Integrity must be verifiable independently.

9. Approval & Release Controls

Before external release:

• Report classification must be confirmed
• Scope must be approved
• Export authorisation logged

No report may be released without recorded approval.

10. Redaction & Minimisation

Reports must:

• Include only required data
• Exclude unrelated personal data
• Apply masking where legally permitted

Data minimisation is mandatory.

11. Jurisdictional Segregation

Where applicable:

• Reports must be jurisdiction-scoped
• Cross-border data leakage prohibited
• Regulatory regimes must not be conflated

Each regulator sees only their mandate.

12. Evidence Traceability

Every reported metric must be traceable to:

• Underlying records
• Audit logs
• Compliance artefacts

Traceability must be machine-verifiable.

13. Export Formats

Permitted formats include:

• PDF (signed, immutable)
• CSV (hash-verified)
• JSON (schema-versioned)

Formats must match regulator requirements.

14. Delivery Channels

Permitted delivery methods:

• Secure regulator portals
• Encrypted file transfer
• Physical media (where mandated)

Email delivery is prohibited unless explicitly authorised.

15. Logging & Audit Trail

All reporting activity must log:

• Who generated the report
• What was generated
• When it was generated
• Who approved release
• How it was delivered

Logs are immutable.

16. Error Handling

If a report fails:

• The failure must be logged
• Partial reports must not be released
• Retried generation must be traceable

Silent failures are prohibited.

17. Change Control

Any change to:

• Report structure
• Included metrics
• Generation logic

Requires formal governance approval and version increment.

18. Retention

Reports must be retained according to:

• Regulatory retention rules
• Data retention doctrine
• Legal hold requirements

Retention periods are non-negotiable.

19. Non-Interpretation Rule

Reports:

• Present facts
• Do not include commentary
• Do not infer conclusions

Interpretation belongs outside the reporting system.
