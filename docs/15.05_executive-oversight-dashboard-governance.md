15.05 — Executive Oversight Dashboard Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance framework for the Executive Oversight Dashboard, which provides senior leadership with strategic, aggregate, and audit-safe visibility across the marketplace.

The dashboard exists to observe system health, risk posture, and performance trends—not to operate, intervene, or override governed workflows.

2. Governing Principle

Executives observe outcomes and risk,
not operational levers.

Strategic oversight must never bypass, weaken, or replace system-enforced governance.

3. Scope

The Executive Oversight Dashboard provides read-only, aggregated insight into:

• Commercial performance
• Risk exposure
• Compliance posture
• Operational stability
• Financial health
• Growth and capacity signals

No transactional or case-level actions are permitted.

4. Role-Based Access

Permitted roles:

• Executive — full read-only visibility
• Board Observer — read-only, export permitted
• Auditor — read-only, evidence-linked

No operational, administrative, or financial execution roles may access this dashboard.

5. Read-Only Enforcement

The dashboard must be strictly non-mutative.

It must not allow:

• Order manipulation
• Payment actions
• Dispute resolution
• Compliance overrides
• Workflow triggers

All controls are observational only.

6. Data Aggregation Rules

Displayed data must be:

• Aggregated
• De-identified
• Non-transactional
• Derived from authoritative sources

No raw records may be exposed.

7. Key Visibility Domains

The dashboard must include, at minimum:

Commercial
• GMV trends
• Order volumes
• Supplier participation

Financial
• Revenue summaries
• Escrow balances (aggregate)
• Exposure indicators

Risk
• Open risk counts
• Escalation trends
• Incident frequency

Compliance
• Supplier compliance rates
• Certification coverage
• Breach indicators

Operations
• SLA adherence
• Delivery reliability
• System uptime

8. Time-Based Trend Analysis

The dashboard must present:

• Period-over-period trends
• Rolling averages
• Anomaly indicators

Real-time data is optional; authoritative accuracy is mandatory.

9. Threshold & Signal Indicators

Permitted indicators:

• Green / Amber / Red status
• Threshold breaches
• Early warning signals

Indicators must link to underlying governed reports.

10. Drill-Down Restrictions

Executives may:

• Navigate to summary reports
• View linked dashboards (read-only)

Executives may not:

• Access case-level controls
• View raw evidence sets
• Perform operational actions

11. Risk & Exposure Visibility

The dashboard must surface:

• Financial exposure summaries
• Open disputes (counts only)
• Regulatory risk indicators

No dispute handling actions permitted.

12. Compliance Posture

Compliance visibility must include:

• Percentage compliant suppliers
• Expired or expiring certifications
• Regulatory alerts (high level)

No compliance decisions occur here.

13. Security & Privacy Controls

The dashboard must enforce:

• Strong authentication
• Role validation
• Session expiry
• Access logging

Sensitive data must remain masked or aggregated.

14. Evidence Linking

Where indicators reference underlying facts:

• Links must resolve to governed reports
• Evidence access must remain read-only
• Hash verification must be preserved

15. Export & Reporting

Permitted exports:

• Executive summaries
• Board-ready reports
• Regulator-safe aggregates

Exports must be timestamped and reproducible.

16. Audit Logging

All access must be logged:

• User identity
• Role
• Views accessed
• Reports exported
• Timestamp

Executive access is auditable.

17. Failure Behaviour

On data or system failure:

• Dashboard must fail closed
• Indicators must not infer or guess
• No stale data shown

Accuracy overrides availability.

18. Change Control

Any change to:

• Executive metrics
• Aggregation logic
• Threshold definitions

Requires formal governance approval.

19. Non-Bypass Rule

The Executive Oversight Dashboard:

• Does not execute
• Does not approve
• Does not override

Strategic insight must not become operational authority.
