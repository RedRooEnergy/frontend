06.06 — Promotions, Discounts & Tier Exclusivity Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative governance framework for promotions, discounts, and tier-based commercial privileges within the marketplace. These mechanisms are treated as regulated commercial instruments, not marketing tools, and must operate without undermining pricing integrity, margin floors, or auditability.

2. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Supplier-funded promotions
• Platform-funded incentives
• Buyer-facing discounts
• Volume-based pricing incentives
• Tier-based visibility and access privileges
• Time-bound promotional campaigns
• Catalogue placement advantages

All promotional activity falls within scope.

3. Governing Principle

Promotions may influence buyer choice but must never distort commercial truth.

Promotions must operate within pre-defined boundaries and never override locked pricing governance.

4. Promotion Eligibility Rules

Promotions may only be applied when:

• The supplier or platform is authorised to offer promotions
• The product is fully compliant and approved
• Margin floors remain intact post-discount
• The promotion complies with tier rules
• The promotion has a defined start and end window

Unauthorised promotions are prohibited.

5. Promotion Types

Permitted promotion types include:

• Percentage-based discounts
• Fixed-amount discounts
• Volume-break incentives
• Catalogue placement prioritisation
• Time-limited featured listings

Unclassified promotion types are prohibited.

6. Discount Governance

All discounts must:

• Reference the original pricing snapshot
• Be calculated deterministically
• Respect non-discountable components
• Preserve minimum margin thresholds

Discount stacking is prohibited unless explicitly governed.

7. Tier Exclusivity Model

The marketplace may operate tiered participation levels, such as:

• Platinum
• Gold
• Silver
• Bronze

Tier benefits may include:

• Catalogue visibility priority
• Access to promotional slots
• Reduced platform fees
• Campaign participation eligibility

Tier definitions must be explicit and versioned.

8. Tier Enforcement Rules

Tier benefits:

• Apply only while tier status is valid
• Are revoked immediately upon compliance failure
• Cannot be manually overridden
• Must be auditable and time-bound

Tier privilege abuse results in escalation.

9. Campaign Lifecycle Governance

Promotional campaigns must follow defined stages:

• Draft
• Review
• Approval
• Active
• Expired
• Archived

Campaign state transitions must be logged.

10. Catalogue Placement Controls

Catalogue ordering influenced by promotions must:

• Be rule-driven
• Be transparent internally
• Be reproducible for audit
• Avoid misleading buyer representation

Manual catalogue manipulation is prohibited.

11. Buyer Transparency Requirements

Buyer-facing presentation must:

• Clearly display discounted values
• Preserve original pricing reference
• Avoid deceptive representations
• Reflect actual commercial terms

Misleading promotions are prohibited.

12. Financial Attribution

All promotional impacts must be attributed to:

• Supplier funding
• Platform funding
• Shared funding arrangements

Attribution must be visible in financial reporting.

13. Abuse & Manipulation Prevention

The system must:

• Detect excessive discount patterns
• Flag margin erosion attempts
• Prevent artificial scarcity
• Block self-dealing or collusion

Automated controls are mandatory.

14. Audit & Evidence Requirements

All promotions must generate:

• Approval records
• Pricing impact calculations
• Tier eligibility confirmations
• Campaign lifecycle logs

These artefacts must be immutable.

15. Regulatory Alignment

Promotions must comply with:

• Consumer protection law
• Pricing transparency requirements
• Anti-misrepresentation rules

Regulatory breaches trigger automatic suspension.

16. Change Control

Changes to promotion governance require:

• Commercial approval
• Legal review
• Risk assessment
• Versioned documentation

Retroactive promotional changes are prohibited.

17. Enforcement Rules

• No promotion without approval
• No discount below margin floors
• No tier privilege without eligibility
• No manual overrides

Violations block campaign activation.
