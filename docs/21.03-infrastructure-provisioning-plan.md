21.03 — Infrastructure Provisioning Plan (Controlled, Reversible)

Document ID: 21.03
Title: Infrastructure Provisioning Plan
Status: DRAFT → LOCKED UPON APPROVAL
Governing Phase: Phase 21 — Change Control & Post-Baseline Execution

1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative, step-by-step infrastructure provisioning sequence for the platform, ensuring that every action is controlled, auditable, reversible, and compliant with governance requirements.

2. Guiding Principles

Infrastructure SHALL be provisioned incrementally

Every step MUST be reversible

No production resources are created until staging is validated

Manual changes are forbidden outside documented steps

Rollback capability is mandatory at every stage

3. Provisioning Order (Mandatory)

Provisioning SHALL occur strictly in the following order:

Development environment

Staging environment

Production environment

No step may be skipped or reordered.

4. Phase A — Development Environment Provisioning
4.1 Resources

One backend compute instance

One database instance

One object storage bucket

One isolated network segment

4.2 Validation

Health checks operational

Logging enabled

Access restricted

4.3 Rollback

Destroy all created resources

Verify zero residual assets

5. Phase B — Staging Environment Provisioning
5.1 Prerequisite

Development environment validated and stable

5.2 Resources

Mirrored backend compute

Mirrored database

Mirrored storage

Mirrored network policies

5.3 Validation

Deployment pipeline functional

Security checks passing

Audit logging verified

5.4 Rollback

Teardown staging resources

Preserve development environment

6. Phase C — Production Environment Provisioning
6.1 Prerequisite

Staging sign-off complete

Change record approved

6.2 Resources

High-availability backend

Production-grade database

Encrypted storage

Monitoring and alerting enabled

6.3 Validation

No public access before validation

Manual approval checkpoint

Full audit logging enabled

6.4 Rollback

Disable ingress

Preserve logs

Tear down compute if required

7. CI/CD Integration

Pipelines SHALL deploy infrastructure declaratively

No ad-hoc provisioning

Infrastructure as Code preferred

Pipeline failures halt progression

8. Evidence & Audit Trail

All provisioning actions logged

Rollback events documented

Evidence stored under Infrastructure Records

9. Approval & Lock

This document becomes immutable upon approval.
