03.02 — IP Ownership & Licensing Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative ownership, control, licensing, and protection framework for all intellectual property associated with the marketplace platform.

Its objectives are to ensure:

• Clear, uncontested IP ownership
• Separation of IP from operational risk
• Controlled licensing to operating entities
• Protection against dilution, leakage, or loss
• Long-term asset defensibility

No system, extension, or commercial activity may exist without alignment to this governance.

2. Governing Principles

IP governance is governed by the following principles:

• Intellectual property is a strategic asset
• Ownership and operation must be separable
• Licensing is explicit, not implied
• Control survives personnel and entity changes
• Platform value depends on IP clarity

Accordingly, IP must never be left implicit or informally assigned.

3. Scope of Intellectual Property

For the purposes of this platform, IP includes but is not limited to:

• Source code (backend, frontend, extensions, scripts)
• System architecture and designs
• Data models and schemas
• Governance frameworks and documentation
• Commercial logic and pricing engines
• CI/CD pipelines and automation
• UX flows and dashboards
• Generated artefacts (catalogues, reports, manifests)
• Trademarks, names, branding, and domain assets

All such IP is governed under this document unless explicitly excluded.

4. IP Ownership Entity

The IP Ownership Entity:

• Is the sole legal owner of all platform IP
• Holds ownership regardless of who authors the work
• Retains ownership through contractors, employees, and partners
• Licenses IP to operating entities under controlled terms

Ownership must be documented contractually for:

• Employees
• Contractors
• Advisors
• External contributors

No contribution is accepted without IP assignment.

5. Assignment of IP from Contributors

All contributors must execute agreements that:

• Assign all foreground IP to the IP Ownership Entity
• Waive moral rights where legally permissible
• Confirm work-for-hire status where applicable
• Prohibit independent reuse of platform IP

Contributions without assignment are invalid and prohibited.

6. Licensing to Marketplace Operator

The IP Ownership Entity grants the Marketplace Operator:

• A non-transferable license to use the platform IP
• License scope limited to platform operation
• No right to sublicense without approval
• No right to modify ownership claims

Licensing terms must define:

• Permitted use
• Prohibited use
• Termination conditions
• Survival clauses

7. Licensing to Extensions and Partners

Where extensions or partner systems require access:

• Access is granted via license, not ownership
• Scope is limited to defined functions
• Reverse engineering is prohibited
• IP leakage controls must exist

No partner receives ownership rights.

8. IP Protection Measures

The following protection measures are mandatory:

• Contractual assignment and licensing
• Access controls on repositories
• Segregation of IP from operational systems
• Documentation of IP provenance
• Audit trails for IP changes

Failure to protect IP is treated as a material risk.

9. Trademarks & Branding

Brand assets must be:

• Owned by the IP Ownership Entity
• Licensed to the Marketplace Operator
• Used consistently with brand governance
• Protected against misuse

Brand usage without license is prohibited.

10. Open Source Interaction

Where open-source software is used:

• Licenses must be reviewed and approved
• Copyleft risks must be identified
• Attribution obligations must be met
• No open-source license may contaminate proprietary IP

Open-source usage must be documented and auditable.

11. IP in Generated Outputs

Generated outputs (catalogues, reports, dashboards):

• Remain platform IP unless explicitly transferred
• May be licensed to users for limited use
• Must not confer ownership rights

12. IP Dispute Handling

In the event of IP dispute:

• IP Ownership Entity retains control
• Access may be suspended pending resolution
• Evidence preservation rules apply
• Legal escalation procedures must be followed

13. Enforcement

The following are explicit violations:

• Accepting contributions without IP assignment
• Granting implied licenses
• Allowing operational entities to claim ownership
• Mixing IP ownership with supplier or partner IP

Violations constitute governance breaches.

14. Change Control

Any change to IP ownership or licensing requires:

• Legal review
• Risk assessment
• Contract amendments
• Governing authority approval
