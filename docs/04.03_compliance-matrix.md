04.03 — Compliance Matrix (Regulation → Obligation → System Control Mapping)
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative compliance matrix for the platform.

Its purpose is to provide a deterministic, auditable mapping between:

• External regulations
• Internal obligations
• Platform-enforced system controls

This matrix ensures that no regulation exists without enforcement and no enforcement exists without authority.

2. Compliance Chain Model

All compliance enforcement follows a strict, non-negotiable chain:

Regulation → Obligation → Control → Evidence → Audit

If any link is missing, compliance is considered failed by design.

3. Matrix Structure

Each row in the compliance matrix represents one enforceable obligation and must include:

• Regulation Identifier
• Regulation Source
• Obligation ID
• Obligation Class (from 04.02)
• Primary Accountable Actor
• System Control Type
• Enforcement Point
• Evidence Generated
• Audit Reference

No column may be omitted.

4. Regulation Identifiers

Regulations are referenced using immutable identifiers:

• AU-CEC-XXX
• AU-EESS-XXX
• AU-ACL-XXX
• AU-GST-XXX
• AU-PRIV-XXX
• AU-CYBER-XXX
• AU-CUSTOMS-XXX

Identifiers are version-locked.

5. Obligation Mapping Rules

Each obligation:

• Must map to exactly one regulation source
• May map to multiple system controls
• Must have a single primary accountable actor

Shared accountability is explicitly prohibited.

6. System Control Types

Controls fall into one or more of the following categories:

• Preventive (blocks action)
• Detective (flags violations)
• Corrective (enforces remediation)
• Compensating (mitigates risk)

At least one preventive or detective control is mandatory per obligation.

7. Enforcement Points

Controls may be enforced at:

• Access control
• Listing submission
• Checkout
• Fulfilment
• Post-transaction
• Administrative review

Enforcement points must be explicit and testable.

8. Evidence Generation Requirements

Each control must generate at least one of:

• Immutable system logs
• Hash-locked documents
• Third-party attestations
• Time-stamped state records

Evidence must be retrievable without human discretion.

9. Audit Alignment

Each obligation is assigned an audit category:

• Internal audit
• External auditor
• Regulator
• Insurer

Audit alignment determines retention and access rules.

10. Sample Matrix Entry (Illustrative)
Regulation ID	Obligation ID	Actor	Control	Enforcement	Evidence
AU-CEC-001	OBL-CEC-CERT	Supplier	Certificate Validation	Listing	Hash-locked cert

This table is illustrative only. The full matrix is maintained in this document.

11. Change Control

Changes to this matrix require:

• Formal change request
• Impact analysis
• Legal review
• Version increment

No exceptions.

12. Relationship to Downstream Systems

This matrix governs:

• Supplier onboarding workflows
• Product catalogue visibility
• Payment release conditions
• Audit exports
• Incident response triggers

It is referenced by every enforcement subsystem.
