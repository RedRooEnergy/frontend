06.05 — Refunds, Disputes & Chargeback Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative governance framework for handling refunds, disputes, and chargebacks across the marketplace. These processes are treated as financial control events with legal and audit implications, not customer-service conveniences.

2. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Buyer-initiated refunds
• Supplier-initiated refunds
• Platform-mandated reversals
• Disputes (buyer, supplier, regulator, payment provider)
• Chargebacks initiated by payment providers
• Evidence handling and resolution outcomes

All post-payment reversals fall within scope.

3. Governing Principle

All reversals are evidence-driven, auditable, and deterministic.

No refund, dispute resolution, or chargeback outcome may occur without a traceable justification and preserved artefacts.

4. Refund Eligibility Rules

Refunds may only be initiated when:

• Refund conditions are explicitly permitted by governance
• The order state allows reversal
• Compliance obligations have failed or been revoked
• Delivery has failed, been cancelled, or is non-conforming
• A dispute resolution outcome mandates refund

Refunds outside defined eligibility are prohibited.

5. Refund Types

Supported refund types include:

• Full refund
• Partial refund
• Item-level refund
• Service component refund
• Platform-fee-only refund (where applicable)

Refund type must be explicitly recorded.

6. Refund Calculation Doctrine

All refund calculations must:

• Reference the original pricing snapshot
• Respect margin floor governance
• Respect non-refundable components
• Be reproducible and verifiable

Ad-hoc or negotiated refund values are prohibited.

7. Dispute Classification

Disputes must be categorised into defined classes:

• Delivery dispute
• Compliance dispute
• Product conformity dispute
• Payment dispute
• Fraud or misuse dispute

Classification governs resolution pathways.

8. Dispute Lifecycle States

Each dispute must progress through defined states:

• Opened
• Under Review
• Evidence Collection
• Provisional Determination
• Final Determination
• Closed

State transitions must be logged.

9. Evidence Requirements

All disputes and refunds require:

• Order records
• Pricing snapshot hash
• Delivery evidence
• Compliance documentation
• Communication logs

Evidence must be immutable and time-stamped.

10. Chargeback Handling Doctrine

Chargebacks are treated as external enforcement events.

Rules:

• Immediate escrow freeze on affected funds
• Automatic dispute record creation
• Evidence submission within provider timelines
• Outcome binding on settlement logic

Manual suppression of chargebacks is prohibited.

11. Financial Impact Handling

Refunds and chargebacks may trigger:

• Escrow reversals
• Supplier clawbacks
• Platform fee reversals
• Service partner adjustments

All impacts must reconcile to ledger records.

12. Timeframe Governance

Refund and dispute timelines must:

• Comply with consumer law
• Comply with payment provider rules
• Be enforced by system timers

Expired actions result in automatic state progression.

13. Abuse Prevention

The system must:

• Detect repeat abuse patterns
• Flag abnormal refund rates
• Escalate high-risk users
• Preserve fraud indicators

Abuse controls are mandatory.

14. Audit & Reporting

All refund and dispute activity must produce:

• Audit logs
• Financial reconciliation entries
• Evidence bundles
• Regulator-ready exports

These records are legally significant.

15. Exception Handling

Exceptional outcomes require:

• Formal justification
• Approval under change control
• Permanent audit record

Silent overrides are prohibited.

16. Change Control

Changes to refund or dispute rules require:

• Legal review
• Financial approval
• Risk assessment
• Versioned governance updates

Retroactive rule changes are prohibited.

17. Enforcement Rules

• No refunds without eligibility
• No disputes without evidence
• No chargeback suppression
• No undocumented reversals

Violations block downstream settlement.
