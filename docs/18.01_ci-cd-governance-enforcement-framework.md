18.01 — CI/CD Governance Enforcement Framework
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative governance framework for CI/CD enforcement across the platform. It establishes how automated pipelines act as mandatory governance gates, ensuring that no code, configuration, or infrastructure change can be introduced without meeting predefined governance, security, and quality standards.

CI/CD is treated as a control surface, not merely a delivery mechanism.

2. Governing Principle

If governance cannot be enforced automatically, it is not governance.

All critical rules must be enforced by pipelines, not by trust or manual process.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Application source code
• Infrastructure-as-code
• Configuration artefacts
• Documentation artefacts
• Dependency definitions
• Deployment workflows

It applies across all repositories, branches, and environments.

4. Mandatory Pipeline Presence

Every repository must have:

• A defined CI pipeline
• A defined CD pipeline (where applicable)
• Branch protection rules enforced

Repositories without pipelines are non-compliant.

5. Governance Gate Categories

CI/CD pipelines must implement gates for:

• Code quality and linting
• Security scanning
• Dependency vulnerability thresholds
• Test execution and coverage
• Governance artefact validation
• Build reproducibility

Failure of any gate must block progression.

6. Branch Protection Enforcement

Protected branches must enforce:

• Required status checks
• Mandatory review approvals
• No force-push
• No direct commits

Governance rules override individual contributor privileges.

7. Governance Artefact Validation

Pipelines must verify:

• Required governance documents exist
• Correct versioning and naming conventions
• Dependency alignment with locked baselines
• Change control references for modifications

Missing or misnamed artefacts must fail builds.

8. Security Enforcement

CI/CD pipelines must:

• Run SAST and dependency scans
• Enforce severity thresholds
• Block merges on Critical findings
• Record scan artefacts immutably

Security failures cannot be waived informally.

9. Test Enforcement

Mandatory test requirements include:

• Unit tests for core logic
• Integration tests for governed workflows
• Regression tests for locked behaviour

Test bypass is prohibited.

10. Build Reproducibility

Pipelines must ensure:

• Deterministic builds
• Immutable artefacts
• Traceable build provenance

Non-reproducible builds are treated as governance failures.

11. Deployment Controls

CD pipelines must:

• Enforce environment separation
• Require explicit promotion steps
• Validate configuration integrity
• Block unauthorised deployment paths

Production deployment requires explicit approval gates.

12. Secrets & Credentials Handling

CI/CD systems must:

• Use secure secret stores
• Prevent secret leakage in logs
• Rotate credentials regularly

Secrets in source control are prohibited.

13. Change Control Integration

Pipelines must require:

• Change request identifiers
• Approved change state
• Traceability to governance documents

Unapproved changes must fail automatically.

14. Exception Handling

Temporary CI/CD exceptions:

• Must be documented
• Must be time-bound
• Must include mitigation

Permanent exceptions are prohibited.

15. Audit & Evidence

CI/CD activity must generate:

• Immutable logs
• Build and deployment records
• Gate pass/fail evidence

These artefacts are audit-eligible.

16. Oversight & Review

CI/CD governance effectiveness must be reviewed via:

• Failed gate metrics
• Exception frequency
• Incident correlation

Pipeline health is a board-level concern.
