3.04 — Buyer Order Tracking & Post-Commitment Visibility Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance rules for buyer visibility after order commitment, including order tracking, shipment status, compliance milestones, and post-commitment transparency.

Its purpose is to ensure that buyers see accurate, system-verified truth, not estimates, assumptions, or aspirational status messages.

2. Governing Principle

Post-commitment visibility reflects recorded system state, not expectation.

Once an order is committed, all buyer-visible information must be derived from governed backend records.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Buyer order detail pages
• Order timelines and milestones
• Shipment tracking displays
• Compliance and document readiness indicators
• Delivery confirmation status

Out of scope:

• Marketing communications
• External carrier portals (unless embedded and governed)

4. Authoritative Data Sources

Buyer-visible order information may only be sourced from:

• Order records
• Pricing snapshot references
• Fulfilment events
• Shipping system events
• Compliance state transitions

Client-side inference is prohibited.

5. Order Timeline Governance

Order timelines must:

• Be sequential and timestamped
• Reflect actual state transitions
• Prevent skipped or implied states

Each timeline entry must map to an auditable event.

6. Shipment Tracking Rules

Shipment tracking displays must:

• Use carrier-verified events
• Reflect last confirmed state
• Avoid speculative “in transit” assumptions

If carrier data is unavailable, the state must reflect that explicitly.

7. Compliance Milestone Visibility

Where compliance milestones apply, buyers may see:

• Document submitted
• Validation in progress
• Approved
• Exception raised

Internal compliance deliberations remain hidden.

8. Document Availability

Buyers may access documents only when:

• Documents are final and approved
• Version is locked
• Access rights are satisfied

Draft or provisional documents are never visible.

9. Multi-Supplier Order Representation

For multi-supplier orders:

• A unified order view is presented
• Supplier-specific fulfilment is clearly delineated
• Partial completion is explicitly shown

Aggregation must not hide incomplete components.

10. Delivery Confirmation

Delivery status is considered confirmed only when:

• Carrier delivery confirmation is received
• Supplier delivery acknowledgement is recorded (if required)
• System verification completes

Buyer “received” confirmation alone is insufficient.

11. Exception & Delay Disclosure

When delays or exceptions occur:

• Buyers must be notified factually
• Root causes are categorised
• Resolution status is shown

No speculative timelines are permitted.

12. Buyer-Initiated Status Actions

Buyer actions (e.g. “report issue”) must:

• Create governed case records
• Not directly alter order state
• Trigger defined workflows

Buyer actions are requests, not state changes.

13. Historical Integrity

Order history must:

• Remain immutable
• Preserve prior states
• Support audit replay

Edits or deletions are prohibited.

14. Error & Data Failure Handling

If tracking data becomes unavailable:

• Status freezes at last known state
• Buyers are informed of data unavailability
• Automatic state advancement is prohibited

Fail-safe behaviour is mandatory.

15. Notifications Integration

Tracking events may trigger notifications only if:

• Notification rules permit
• Events are confirmed
• Notification content reflects system truth

Notification does not equal state change.

16. Audit & Evidence

Post-commitment visibility must be supported by:

• Event logs
• Timestamped state transitions
• Document access records

Buyer-visible views must be reproducible for audit.

17. Security & Privacy

Tracking information must:

• Respect data minimisation
• Avoid exposing internal identifiers
• Prevent cross-order data leakage

Access control is enforced at every request.

18. Change Control

Any change affecting:

• Tracking logic
• Visibility rules
• Timeline construction

Requires formal governance approval.

19. Enforcement Status

This governance is:

• Mandatory
• Runtime-enforced
• Non-bypassable

UI workarounds are prohibited.
