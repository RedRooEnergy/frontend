01.09 — Success Criteria & Failure Conditions

Project Name: RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace
Document Type: Foundational Governance Artefact
Phase: Phase 1 — Master Project Definition
Status: DRAFT (to be approved and locked)
Change Control: Not active (pre-baseline)

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the objective success criteria and explicit failure conditions for the RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace.

Its purpose is to:

Remove ambiguity about completion

Prevent subjective declarations of “ready”

Provide enforceable gates for progression and launch

Success is not inferred. It is demonstrated.

2. Definition of Success

Success is defined as the platform meeting all mandatory criteria across governance, technical operation, compliance, and operational readiness.

Partial success does not exist.

3. Primary Success Criteria (Mandatory)

All criteria below must be satisfied simultaneously.

3.1 Governance Completeness

The platform is successful only if:

All governance documents defined in the Master Project Index exist

Each document is versioned, approved, and locked

No build artefact exists without a governing document

Change control is operational post-baseline

Failure to meet any item constitutes failure.

3.2 Regulatory & Compliance Enforceability

The platform is successful only if:

Compliance rules are enforced by system logic

Suppliers cannot transact without validated compliance

Compliance revocation propagates correctly

Evidence required by regulators is exportable

Compliance must be systemic, not procedural.

3.3 Data Integrity & Auditability

The platform is successful only if:

All committed records are immutable

Audit logs capture who, what, when, and why

Hashes can be verified independently

Historical state reconstruction is possible

Any silent mutation is a failure.

3.4 Commercial Rule Enforcement

The platform is successful only if:

Pricing snapshots are locked at commitment

Margin floors cannot be violated

Discounts are validated against governance rules

Funds cannot be released without conditions met

Financial correctness is non-negotiable.

3.5 Controlled Role-Based Authority

The platform is successful only if:

Roles are explicitly defined

Permissions are enforced server-side

Administrators cannot bypass governance

All privileged actions are logged

Power must be constrained, not trusted.

3.6 Operational Stability

The platform is successful only if:

Core services remain available under partial failure

External service failures do not corrupt state

Timeouts prevent system deadlock

Recovery does not require data correction

Operational resilience is required.

3.7 Evidence-Ready Deployment

The platform is successful only if:

Audit packs can be generated on demand

Regulator exports are complete and verifiable

Evidence chains are intact across lifecycle events

If proof cannot be produced, success is invalid.

4. Secondary Success Indicators (Non-Gating)

The following indicators support success but do not override primary criteria:

Performance within defined tolerances

Usability that reflects system truth

Automation that reduces manual intervention

These indicators cannot compensate for governance failure.

5. Explicit Failure Conditions

The platform is considered a failure if any of the following occur.

5.1 Governance Failure

Failure occurs if:

Documents are missing or unsigned

Features exist without governance artefacts

Baselines are modified without change control

This includes “temporary” deviations.

5.2 Compliance Failure

Failure occurs if:

Non-compliant suppliers can transact

Compliance states are ignored or overridden

Evidence cannot be produced on demand

Regulatory exposure is unacceptable.

5.3 Data Integrity Failure

Failure occurs if:

Records are altered without trace

Audit logs are incomplete or inconsistent

Hash verification fails

Trust in the system is lost.

5.4 Financial Failure

Failure occurs if:

Pricing changes post-commitment

Funds are released prematurely

Settlement rules are bypassed

Financial leakage invalidates the platform.

5.5 Authority Failure

Failure occurs if:

Admins can bypass rules

Roles are ambiguous or overlapping

Privileged actions are not logged

Unchecked power is a systemic defect.

5.6 Operational Failure

Failure occurs if:

External outages corrupt state

Recovery requires manual data fixes

Failures cannot be reconstructed

Operational opacity is unacceptable.

6. Go / No-Go Determination

A Go decision requires:

All primary success criteria met

No unresolved failure conditions

Evidence packs verified

A No-Go decision is automatic if any failure condition exists.

7. Post-Launch Implications

Once launched:

Success criteria continue to apply

Failure conditions trigger escalation

Change control governs all remediation

Launch does not relax standards.

8. Locking and Authority

Upon approval, this document shall be:

Marked APPROVED

Version-locked

Used as the definitive reference for readiness decisions

Cited in deployment and audit processes

Disputes are resolved against this document.
