Phase: 7 — Core Data Models & Immutability
Upstream Dependencies: 07.04 — Document Integrity & Hashing
Downstream Dependencies: Phase 8 — Data Architecture Implementation
Status: DRAFT (Lock-Ready)

1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory enforcement mechanisms by which Immutable Core governance rules are applied and enforced.

Governance is executable, not advisory.

2. Mandatory Enforcement — 07.05.X

Governance enforcement defined in the Immutable Core is mandatory and blocking.

Any operation, workflow, or deployment that violates Core rules must be automatically prevented from proceeding.

3. No Advisory Governance — 07.05.Y

Governance controls in the Core are not advisory, optional, or discretionary.

Failure to satisfy Core governance conditions halts execution until compliance is restored.

4. Non-Circumvention Rule — 07.05.Z

No extension, configuration, operational procedure, or administrative action may:

• Circumvent
• Suppress
• Weaken

Core governance enforcement mechanisms under any circumstances.
