# Admin UI Doctrine

Governance State: CORE + EXTENSIONS LOCKED
Enforcement State: LIVE

Admins can:
- View system state
- Audit decisions and enforcement outcomes
- Escalate issues through formal processes

Admins cannot:
- Bypass Core enforcement
- Edit immutable records
- Override pricing snapshots
- Modify audit logs

UI Role:
Admin UI provides oversight and evidence, not authority.
