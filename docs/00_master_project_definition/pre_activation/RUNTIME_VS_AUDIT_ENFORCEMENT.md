# Runtime vs Audit Enforcement Separation

Version: v0.1 DRAFT
Governance State: PAUSED

Runtime Enforcement:
- Prevents invalid actions from occurring
- Must be deterministic and non-bypassable
- Applies to identity, pricing, and compliance gating

Audit Enforcement:
- Detects and evidences violations
- Does not block runtime execution
- Supports regulators, investors, and insurers

Rule:
No audit mechanism may replace a required runtime control.
