# Lock Readiness Declaration

Date: 2026-01-24
Governance State: PAUSED
Readiness Status: LOCK-READY (Not Locked)

Summary:
All governance health checks (PASS 1–PASS 5) have been completed and resolved
to PASS. Core, Extensions, repository structure, operational doctrine,
compliance, and commercial rules are internally consistent and auditable.

Declarations:
- The Immutable Core exists and is complete but remains DRAFT.
- Extensions are governed, lifecycle-consistent, and UNLOCKED.
- The repository boundary is explicit and isolated.
- No enforcement, activation, or production lock has occurred.

Conclusion:
The project is LOCK-READY. Formal locking may proceed only through explicit
change control and authorisation.
