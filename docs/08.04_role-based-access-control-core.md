08.04 — Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Core
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative authorization model enforced by the Immutable Core. RBAC governs what an authenticated identity is permitted to do, under which conditions, and with what audit guarantees.

RBAC is a governance enforcement mechanism, not a convenience layer.

2. Authorization Doctrine

Identity authenticates. Roles authorize. Governance constrains. Audit proves.

The RBAC Core must guarantee:

• Deterministic authorization outcomes
• Explicit separation of identity, role, and permission
• Non-bypassable enforcement at all execution boundaries
• Complete auditability of authorization decisions

No action may execute without an evaluated authorization decision.

3. Separation of Concerns

RBAC is strictly separate from:

• Authentication (identity verification)
• Business logic (extensions)
• UI affordances (frontend controls)

Authorization is enforced server-side, independent of UI state.

4. Core Concepts

Identity
An authenticated principal resolved by 08.03.

Role
A named, governed collection of permissions.

Permission
An explicit, atomic allowance to perform a defined action.

Scope
The bounded context within which a permission applies.

5. Canonical Role Model

Each role record must contain:

• role_id (immutable)
• role_name (unique, governed)
• role_description
• role_scope (global | domain | resource-bound)
• created_at_utc
• created_by_identity_id
• role_hash (immutable)

Role records are immutable once activated.

6. Permission Model

Permissions must be:

• Explicitly enumerated
• Verb-based (e.g. CREATE_ORDER, APPROVE_SUPPLIER)
• Scope-aware
• Non-overlapping

Wildcard permissions are prohibited.

7. Role–Permission Binding

Rules:

• Roles bind permissions explicitly
• Permissions cannot exist without a governing document
• Permission sets are immutable once role is active

Role updates require formal change control and versioning.

8. Role Assignment

Role assignment rules:

• Roles are assigned to identities, not sessions
• Assignments are auditable events
• Assignments may be time-bound or conditional

Every assignment must include:

• Assigning authority
• Justification reference
• Effective date

9. Role Lifecycle

Role states:

• Draft
• Active
• Deprecated
• Retired

Rules:

• Active roles cannot be modified
• Deprecated roles remain evaluable
• Retired roles cannot be assigned

No role deletion is permitted.

10. Authorization Evaluation Flow

For every protected action:

Resolve authenticated identity

Resolve assigned roles

Resolve permissions per role

Evaluate scope and constraints

Emit authorization decision

Allow or deny execution

Failures must fail closed.

11. Denial Semantics

Authorization denials must be:

• Explicit
• Deterministic
• Audited

Silent denials or UI-only restrictions are prohibited.

12. Contextual Constraints

RBAC supports contextual constraints, including:

• Resource ownership
• Compliance state
• Transaction phase
• Escrow state

Constraints must be evaluated in addition to permissions.

13. System & Integration Roles

System and integration identities:

• Use dedicated roles
• Have minimal permissions
• Are scoped to specific functions

Shared system roles are prohibited.

14. Privilege Escalation Controls

The Core must prevent:

• Implicit privilege inheritance
• Role chaining without approval
• Temporary elevation without audit

All elevation requires governance approval.

15. Audit Requirements

Every authorization decision must log:

• Identity
• Roles evaluated
• Permissions checked
• Decision outcome
• Timestamp

Authorization logs are immutable.

16. Extension Interaction

Extensions may:

• Declare required permissions
• Request authorization evaluation

Extensions may not:

• Grant permissions
• Modify roles
• Override authorization outcomes

Authorization authority remains Core-only.

17. Failure & Abuse Handling

The Core must:

• Detect repeated authorization failures
• Flag suspicious access patterns
• Escalate privilege misuse

Blocking decisions must be auditable.

18. Non-Functional Guarantees

RBAC prioritises:

• Safety over convenience
• Explicitness over flexibility
• Auditability over performance
