04.05 — Supplier Compliance Validation Model
1. Purpose

This document defines the supplier compliance validation model enforced by the platform.

It specifies how suppliers are assessed, validated, approved, monitored, and—if required—restricted or removed. Supplier compliance is a continuous system state, not a one-time approval.

2. Governing Principle

No supplier may:

• Onboard
• Submit products
• Appear in catalogues
• Receive payments

unless their compliance state is VALID at the time of the action.

Compliance validation is automated, deterministic, and audit-logged.

3. Supplier Compliance States

Each supplier exists in exactly one of the following immutable states:

• PENDING — onboarding initiated, validation incomplete
• UNDER_REVIEW — documents submitted, validation in progress
• VALID — fully compliant and operational
• RESTRICTED — limited operations permitted
• SUSPENDED — no operational activity permitted
• REVOKED — permanently removed

State transitions are governed and logged.

4. Validation Dimensions

Supplier compliance validation evaluates all of the following dimensions:

• Legal entity verification
• Identity and authority verification
• Mandatory certifications (per 04.04)
• Jurisdictional eligibility
• Regulatory risk flags
• Historical incident linkage

Failure in any dimension blocks approval.

5. Validation Workflow

Supplier validation proceeds through the following enforced steps:

Identity and entity data submission

Mandatory document upload

Automated format and integrity checks

Authority and issuer verification

Jurisdiction and scope alignment

Compliance decision recording

No step may be skipped or reordered.

6. Ongoing Compliance Monitoring

Compliance is continuously monitored for:

• Certificate expiry
• Regulatory updates
• Revocation notices
• Incident triggers
• Audit findings

Any negative change triggers immediate re-evaluation.

7. Restriction & Suspension Rules

A supplier may be RESTRICTED or SUSPENDED if:

• A required certificate expires
• A regulator issues an adverse notice
• An incident investigation is opened
• Data integrity anomalies are detected

Restrictions are applied automatically where possible.

8. Impact of Non-Compliance

Non-compliance results in one or more of:

• Product delisting
• Catalogue exclusion
• Order intake suspension
• Payment holds
• Escalation to incident management

Impacts are proportional but enforced immediately.

9. Evidence & Audit Logging

For each validation decision, the system must record:

• Compliance state snapshot
• Validation inputs and outputs
• Decision timestamp
• Responsible system component
• Linked documents and hashes

Logs are immutable and exportable.

10. Manual Intervention Controls

Manual actions are limited to:

• Review acknowledgement
• Escalation classification
• Regulator correspondence recording

Manual approval of compliance is prohibited.

11. Change Control

Changes to supplier compliance rules require:

• Regulatory or legal justification
• Compliance impact analysis
• Versioned documentation update
• Forward-only application
