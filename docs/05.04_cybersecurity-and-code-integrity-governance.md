05.04 — Cybersecurity & Code Integrity Governance
1. Purpose

This document establishes the mandatory cybersecurity and code integrity governance for the marketplace.
Security is a design constraint and governance obligation, not an optional control layer.

2. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Source code repositories
• CI/CD pipelines
• Build artefacts
• Infrastructure configuration
• Dependencies and third-party libraries
• Secrets and credentials
• Runtime environments
• Administrative access paths

All platform components are in scope.

3. Security Governance Principles

The platform enforces the following principles:

• Least privilege by default
• Explicit trust boundaries
• Immutable build artefacts
• Defense in depth
• Fail-safe defaults
• Auditability of all security actions

Convenience must never override security correctness.

4. Code Integrity Doctrine

All executable code must:

• Originate from version-controlled repositories
• Be traceable to an approved commit
• Pass automated security checks
• Be reproducible from source
• Be immutable once deployed

Untraceable code is prohibited.

5. Repository Governance

Repositories must enforce:

• Branch protection rules
• Mandatory code review
• Restricted write access
• Signed commits where supported
• Immutable release tags

Direct commits to protected branches are forbidden.

6. Dependency Management

Dependencies must be:

• Explicitly declared
• Version-pinned
• Scanned for vulnerabilities
• Reviewed before upgrade

Unapproved dependency upgrades are prohibited.

7. Vulnerability Scanning

The platform mandates:

• Static application security testing (SAST)
• Dependency vulnerability scanning
• Container image scanning (where applicable)

Critical findings block merges and deployments.

8. Secrets Management

Secrets must:

• Never be committed to source control
• Be stored in approved secret managers
• Be rotated on defined schedules
• Be access-logged

Hardcoded secrets are treated as critical incidents.

9. CI/CD Security Controls

CI/CD pipelines must enforce:

• Identity verification for runners
• Isolated build environments
• Artifact integrity checks
• Environment separation (dev/staging/prod)

Pipelines are security-critical systems.

10. Access Control

Administrative and developer access must:

• Use strong authentication
• Enforce role-based permissions
• Be logged and auditable
• Be reviewed periodically

Dormant access must be revoked.

11. Runtime Security

Production environments must include:

• Network segmentation
• Rate limiting
• Intrusion detection hooks
• Health and integrity checks

Runtime security failures trigger incident handling.

12. Logging & Monitoring

Security-relevant events must be:

• Logged centrally
• Time-synchronised
• Tamper-resistant
• Retained per retention doctrine

Logs are legal artefacts.

13. Incident Integration

Security incidents must:

• Generate incident records
• Trigger escalation rules
• Preserve forensic evidence
• Update the risk register

Security governance integrates with incident governance.

14. Third-Party Security

Third-party services must:

• Meet minimum security standards
• Be assessed for risk
• Be monitored for advisories
• Be revocable if compromised

Trust is conditional and reviewed.

15. Compliance Alignment

Security controls must align with:

• Regulatory requirements
• Industry best practice
• Contractual obligations

Misalignment is a governance failure.

16. Review & Audit

Security governance must be:

• Reviewed regularly
• Auditable on demand
• Updated in response to threats

Stagnant security is non-compliant.

17. Change Control

Security-related changes require:

• Risk assessment
• Approval by security authority
• Versioned documentation updates

Emergency changes remain auditable.

18. Enforcement Rules

• No deployment with unresolved critical vulnerabilities
• No bypass of security scans
• No unsigned or untraceable code
• No unmanaged secrets

Violations block system progression.

19. Status

Status: DRAFT
Phase: 5 — Risk Management & Incident Governance
Upstream Dependencies: 05.03 approved
Downstream Dependencies: 05.05 Security Hardening & Monitoring Governance
