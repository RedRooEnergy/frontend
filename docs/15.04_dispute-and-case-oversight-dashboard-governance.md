5.04 — Dispute & Case Oversight Dashboard Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance rules for the Dispute & Case Oversight Dashboard, which provides centralised, audit-grade visibility into disputes, incidents, escalations, and investigative cases across the marketplace.

This dashboard exists to observe, coordinate, and evidence cases — not to adjudicate outcomes or override governed workflows.

2. Governing Principle

Cases are resolved by process.
Oversight confirms adherence, not outcomes.

Human review must never bypass system-enforced resolution paths.

3. Scope

Applies to oversight of:

• Buyer disputes
• Supplier disputes
• Payment disputes and chargebacks
• Compliance breaches
• Operational incidents
• Investigations and escalations

Accessible by authorised oversight roles only.

4. Role-Based Access Control

Defined roles:

• Case Manager — oversight, coordination, escalation
• Compliance Officer — compliance case visibility
• Finance Observer — payment dispute visibility (read-only)
• Auditor — read-only, evidence export
• Admin — restricted, non-operational visibility

No role grants authority to directly resolve disputes outside governed workflows.

5. Read-Only Enforcement

The Dispute & Case Oversight Dashboard must be strictly non-mutative.

It must not permit:

• Direct dispute resolution
• Manual refunds or reversals
• Compliance overrides
• Status manipulation

All actions occur via formal workflows outside the dashboard.

6. Case Types & Classification

The dashboard must categorise cases as:

• Payment disputes
• Delivery disputes
• Compliance failures
• Documentation issues
• System incidents
• Regulatory notifications

Each case must have a single authoritative classification.

7. Case Lifecycle Visibility

For every case, the dashboard must display:

• Case ID
• Type and severity
• Originating trigger
• Current state
• Assigned owner
• SLA timers

Lifecycle states are immutable once recorded.

8. Evidence & Artefact Visibility

Each case must surface linked artefacts:

• Orders
• Transactions
• Pricing snapshots
• Compliance documents
• Communications logs
• System events

Evidence is read-only and hash-verifiable.

9. Dispute State Transparency

The dashboard must show:

• Open disputes
• Pending responses
• Escalated disputes
• Resolved disputes

No inferred or aggregated states permitted.

10. Payment Dispute Handling

For payment-related cases, the dashboard must display:

• Payment provider reference
• Dispute reason codes
• Financial exposure
• Provider deadlines

The dashboard must not interact with payment providers.

11. Compliance Case Visibility

Compliance cases must show:

• Breach category
• Regulatory impact
• Evidence set
• Required remediation

Compliance decisions remain outside the dashboard.

12. SLA & Time-Based Monitoring

The dashboard must surface:

• Response deadlines
• Escalation thresholds
• Breach timers

Timers are system-generated and immutable.

13. Escalation Controls

Permitted oversight actions:

• Flag case for escalation
• Assign or reassign owner
• Request additional evidence
• Trigger investigation workflow

Each action must be logged and non-financial.

14. Cross-Domain Linking

Cases must link to:

• Orders
• Payments
• Suppliers
• Buyers (masked)
• Compliance records
• Audit logs

Links are navigational only.

15. Alerts & Notifications

The dashboard may display alerts for:

• SLA breaches
• Escalated disputes
• Regulatory risk cases

Alerts do not allow direct intervention.

16. Export & Audit Support

The dashboard must support:

• Case evidence packs
• Timeline exports
• Regulator-ready case reports

Exports must be reproducible and hash-verifiable.

17. Audit Logging

All dashboard interactions must log:

• User identity
• Role
• Cases viewed
• Exports generated
• Timestamps

Oversight access is auditable.

18. Security Controls

The dashboard must enforce:

• Strong authentication
• Role-based access
• Session timeouts
• IP and device logging

Suspicious access is treated as an incident.

19. Failure Behaviour

On system failure:

• Dashboard must fail closed
• No partial case states shown
• No cached or stale data displayed

Case truth must remain authoritative.

20. Change Control

Any changes affecting:

• Case visibility
• Lifecycle representation
• Evidence linkage

Require formal change control approval.

21. Non-Bypass Rule

The Dispute & Case Oversight Dashboard:

• Cannot resolve disputes
• Cannot issue refunds
• Cannot override compliance
• Cannot alter case states

Oversight does not equal authority.
