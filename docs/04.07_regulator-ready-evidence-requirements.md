04.07 — Regulator-Ready Evidence Requirements
1. Purpose

This document defines the minimum evidence standards the platform must maintain to satisfy regulator inspections, audits, and lawful information requests at any time.

Evidence readiness is a continuous system obligation, not a post-incident activity.

2. Governing Principle

All regulated activity must be supported by evidence that is:

• Complete
• Verifiable
• Time-bound
• Immutable
• Reproducible

If evidence cannot be produced on demand, the system is considered non-compliant.

3. Evidence Categories

The platform must maintain regulator-ready evidence across the following categories:

• Supplier identity and legal status
• Certifications and approvals
• Product compliance artefacts
• Pricing and commercial records
• Payment and settlement records
• Freight, customs, and tax artefacts
• Incident and revocation records
• Audit logs and system events

Each category is mandatory where applicable.

4. Evidence Format Standards

Evidence artefacts must meet these standards:

• Non-editable once accepted
• Versioned with history preserved
• Timestamped with system time
• Linked to governing records
• Hash-verifiable

Accepted formats are restricted to approved document types.

5. Evidence Linkage Rules

Every evidence artefact must be linked to:

• Supplier ID (where applicable)
• Product ID (where applicable)
• Order ID (where applicable)
• Compliance state version
• Jurisdiction

Unlinked evidence is invalid.

6. Evidence Completeness Rules

The system must prevent progression if required evidence is missing:

• No supplier approval without identity evidence
• No product publication without compliance evidence
• No checkout without pricing snapshot evidence
• No settlement without delivery and compliance evidence

Blocking is automatic and non-overrideable.

7. Evidence Retention Requirements

Evidence must be retained for:

• Minimum statutory retention period (per jurisdiction)
• Longer if required by contract or audit

Retention periods are enforced automatically.

8. Regulator Access Modes

Evidence must be exportable via:

• Structured evidence packs
• Read-only regulator portals (if enabled)
• Time-scoped, jurisdiction-scoped exports

All exports are logged and hashed.

9. Evidence Pack Composition

A regulator-ready evidence pack must include:

• Scope definition
• Evidence index
• Artefact files
• Hash manifest
• System metadata

Packs must be reproducible from source data.

10. Evidence Integrity Verification

The platform must support:

• Hash validation
• Version comparison
• Chain-of-custody review

Verification tools are internal and exportable.

11. Failure Handling

If evidence is missing, corrupted, or unverifiable:

• Incident response is triggered
• Compliance state is suspended where required
• Regulator notification rules apply

Evidence failure is treated as a compliance incident.

12. Manual Handling Restrictions

Manual evidence handling is limited to:

• Review and classification
• Regulator correspondence logging

Manual evidence creation or alteration is prohibited.

13. Change Control

Changes to evidence requirements require:

• Legal review
• Regulatory impact assessment
• Versioned documentation update
