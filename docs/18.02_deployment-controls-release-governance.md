18.02 — Deployment Controls & Release Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative governance framework for deployment and release controls. It ensures that all releases are deliberate, traceable, auditable, and aligned with approved governance artefacts and change control decisions.

Deployment is treated as a regulated event, not an operational routine.

2. Governing Principle

Nothing reaches production without explicit, recorded authority.

All deployments must be intentional, verifiable, and reversible.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Application releases (frontend and backend)
• Infrastructure changes
• Configuration updates
• Schema migrations
• Third-party integration changes

It applies across development, staging, and production environments.

4. Environment Separation

The platform must maintain strict separation between:

• Development
• Staging / Pre-production
• Production

Cross-environment promotion must occur only via governed pipelines.

5. Release Classification

Every deployment must be classified as one of:

• Standard release
• Emergency release
• Security hotfix
• Configuration-only change

Classification determines approval depth and testing requirements.

6. Release Prerequisites

Before deployment, the following must be satisfied:

• CI pipelines fully green
• Governance artefacts validated
• Change request approved
• Security and test gates passed

Failure of any prerequisite blocks deployment.

7. Approval Authority

Each release requires:

• Identified release owner
• Approval by designated authority
• Timestamped approval record

Automated approvals without attribution are prohibited.

8. Deployment Mechanisms

Deployments must occur only via:

• Approved CD pipelines
• Versioned artefacts
• Immutable build outputs

Manual production changes are prohibited.

9. Rollback Capability

All releases must support:

• Defined rollback procedures
• Version reversion capability
• Data integrity protection

Rollback paths must be tested periodically.

10. Configuration Governance

Configuration changes must:

• Be version-controlled
• Pass validation checks
• Be traceable to change control

Runtime configuration drift is prohibited.

11. Schema & Data Migration Governance

Data and schema changes must:

• Be backward-compatible where possible
• Include migration and rollback plans
• Be validated in staging

Unreversible migrations require explicit risk acceptance.

12. Emergency Release Rules

Emergency releases:

• Require post-release review
• Must be documented retroactively
• Cannot bypass security controls

Emergency status must not become routine.

13. Release Evidence & Logging

Each deployment must generate:

• Deployment logs
• Artefact identifiers
• Environment metadata
• Approval records

These artefacts are immutable and audit-eligible.

14. Post-Deployment Validation

After release, the system must:

• Perform health checks
• Validate critical workflows
• Monitor error and alert signals

Deployment is incomplete until validation passes.

15. Failure Handling

Failed deployments must:

• Trigger immediate alerts
• Halt further promotion
• Preserve forensic evidence

Silent failures are prohibited.

16. Oversight & Reporting

Release governance metrics must include:

• Deployment frequency
• Rollback rate
• Failed release count
• Emergency release frequency

Metrics feed executive and board reporting.
