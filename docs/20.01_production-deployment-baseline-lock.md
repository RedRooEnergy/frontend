20.01 — Production Deployment & Baseline Lock Doctrine
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative doctrine for production deployment and baseline lock. It governs the formal transition of the platform from pre-production to live operation and establishes the immutable baseline against which all future changes are measured.

Production deployment is treated as a governance event, not a technical milestone.

2. Governing Principle

Once the platform is live, change is controlled—not improvised.

The production baseline represents the legally, operationally, and technically authoritative state of the platform.

3. Scope

This doctrine applies to:

• Initial production deployment
• Activation of formal change control
• Baseline artefact locking
• Post-go-live operational posture

It applies to all production environments and assets.

4. Preconditions for Production Deployment

Production deployment may occur only when:

• All Phases 0–19 are completed and signed off
• UAT, soak, and failure testing approvals exist
• Security hardening is verified
• CI/CD enforcement is active
• Deployment and rollback procedures are tested

Failure to meet any precondition blocks deployment.

5. Production Deployment Event

The production deployment event must:

• Be scheduled and approved
• Identify deployment owner and authority
• Use governed CI/CD pipelines only
• Deploy versioned, immutable artefacts

Manual production changes are prohibited.

6. Environment Finalisation

At deployment time, the following must be confirmed:

• Correct environment configuration
• Secrets and credentials finalised
• Monitoring and alerting active
• Logging and audit pipelines operational

Production without observability is prohibited.

7. Baseline Definition

The production baseline consists of:

• Application versions (frontend and backend)
• Infrastructure configuration
• Database schema state
• Governance artefacts
• CI/CD enforcement rules

This baseline is immutable once locked.

8. Baseline Lock Activation

Upon successful deployment:

• Baseline lock is activated
• All artefacts are marked read-only
• Change control is formally enabled

Any modification now requires approved change control.

9. Change Control Transition

After baseline lock:

• All changes require change requests
• Risk assessment is mandatory
• Governance approval is required
• Audit trails must be maintained

Emergency changes remain governed.

10. Post-Deployment Validation

Immediately after deployment:

• Health checks must pass
• Critical workflows must be validated
• Monitoring signals must be reviewed

Deployment is incomplete until validation succeeds.

11. Communication & Declaration

The production launch must be:

• Formally declared
• Communicated to stakeholders
• Logged as a governance event

Silent launches are prohibited.

12. Operational Readiness

Post-deployment, the platform must demonstrate:

• Incident response readiness
• Support and escalation capability
• Reporting and oversight functionality

Operational unreadiness invalidates deployment.

13. Residual Risk Declaration

Any residual risk at go-live must be:

• Explicitly documented
• Accepted by authorised governance
• Scheduled for review

Implicit risk acceptance is prohibited.

14. Evidence & Audit Readiness

Production deployment must generate:

• Deployment records
• Approval artefacts
• Baseline manifests
• Hash verification evidence

These artefacts are audit-eligible.

15. Irreversibility Statement

Once baseline lock is active:

• The platform is considered live
• Historical state must be preserved
• Rollback becomes a governed event

The system enters its operational lifecycle.

16. Status

Status: DRAFT

Upstream Dependencies:
• Phase 19 — UAT, Soak & Failure Testing
