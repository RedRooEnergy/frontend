12.02 — Payment Provider Integration Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance rules for integrating external payment providers into the marketplace. Its objective is to ensure that payment providers act strictly as execution channels, never as sources of truth, business logic, or governance authority.

2. Governing Principle

Payment providers execute instructions. The platform governs outcomes.

No provider is permitted to define pricing, settlement timing, dispute authority, or compliance state.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Payment gateway integrations
• Wallet and card processors
• Alternative payment methods
• Webhook handling
• Provider authentication and credentials

Out of scope:

• Provider internal risk scoring logic
• Provider customer support processes

4. Provider Classification

All payment providers are classified as:

Execution-Only Financial Agents

They must:

• Accept platform-generated payment intents
• Execute authorised transactions
• Report outcomes back to the platform

They must not:

• Modify transaction amounts
• Alter settlement timing
• Bypass escrow controls

5. Approved Provider Registry

The platform must maintain an internal registry of:

• Approved payment providers
• Enabled payment methods per provider
• Jurisdictional eligibility
• Activation status

Only registry-approved providers may be used.

6. Provider Credential Management

Provider credentials must:

• Be stored securely
• Be environment-scoped (dev / staging / production)
• Never be embedded in source code

Credential rotation must be supported.

7. Payment Intent Ownership

All payment intents must be:

• Created by the platform
• Signed internally
• Mapped to immutable pricing snapshots

Providers may not generate their own intents.

8. Webhook Governance

Webhook handling must enforce:

• Signature verification
• Idempotency controls
• Replay protection
• Strict event schema validation

Unverified webhooks are rejected.

9. Event Source of Truth

The platform determines:

• Whether a payment is valid
• Whether escrow should be created
• Whether settlement eligibility exists

Provider-reported events are inputs, not decisions.

10. Multi-Provider Consistency Rules

All providers must conform to:

• Identical escrow semantics
• Identical pricing snapshot enforcement
• Identical settlement triggers

No provider-specific shortcuts are permitted.

11. Failure & Degradation Handling

If a provider becomes unavailable:

• New payments are suspended
• Existing escrow remains intact
• No forced settlements occur

Provider outages must not corrupt state.

12. Dispute Integration

When providers signal disputes:

• Escrow is frozen immediately
• Internal dispute workflow is triggered
• Evidence pack generation begins

Provider timelines do not override internal rules.

13. Refund Authority

Refunds may only be initiated when:

• Platform governance authorises the action
• Refund amount aligns with pricing snapshot
• Refund state is recorded before execution

Providers may not auto-refund.

14. Currency & Method Restrictions

Providers must:

• Support platform-approved currencies
• Honour declared payment methods
• Reject unsupported combinations

Fallback logic must be explicit.

15. Logging & Traceability

Each provider interaction must log:

• Provider identifier
• Transaction reference
• Event timestamp
• Platform decision outcome

Logs must be immutable.

16. Security & Abuse Controls

The integration must enforce:

• Rate limiting
• Signature verification
• Credential scope enforcement

Provider abuse signals are advisory only.

17. Compliance Alignment

Provider integrations must support:

• Audit evidence extraction
• Regulator-ready exports
• Historical replay of events

Black-box providers are not acceptable.

18. Deactivation Rules

A provider may be deactivated when:

• Compliance requirements change
• Provider reliability degrades
• Security posture becomes unacceptable

Deactivation must not break historical records.

19. Change Control

Any change to:

• Provider list
• Integration logic
• Webhook processing

Requires formal change control approval.
