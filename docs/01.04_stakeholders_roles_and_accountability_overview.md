01.04 — Stakeholders, Roles & Accountability Overview

Project Name: RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace
Document Type: Foundational Governance Artefact
Phase: Phase 1 — Master Project Definition
Status: DRAFT (to be approved and locked)
Change Control: Not active (pre-baseline)

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the stakeholders and role classes that exist within the RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace.

It answers the question:

Who are the actors in this system, and what are they fundamentally responsible for?

This document does not define:

Decision authority

Permissions

Approval thresholds

Workflow logic

Those are defined in later governance artefacts. This document establishes the human and organisational landscape only.

2. Stakeholder Classification Principles

All stakeholders are classified using the following principles:

Every role has a clearly defined accountability

No role exists without an identifiable responsibility

Roles are separated to avoid conflicts of interest

System access and authority are derived later from these definitions

Roles may be held by individuals, organisations, or automated agents, but accountability always maps to a legal or operational entity.

3. Primary Stakeholder Groups
3.1 Marketplace Owner / Operator

Description:
The legal entity responsible for owning, operating, and governing the marketplace platform.

Core Accountability:

Platform governance and integrity

Regulatory compliance at the platform level

Enforcement of marketplace rules

Custody of audit records and evidence

Oversight of payments orchestration (not funds custody)

This stakeholder is ultimately accountable to regulators, auditors, and counterparties.

3.2 Buyers

Description:
Individuals or organisations that purchase products through the marketplace.

Core Accountability:

Providing accurate identity and transactional information

Using the platform in accordance with published terms

Accepting delivery and contractual obligations

Buyers do not control compliance, pricing rules, or supplier behaviour.

3.3 Suppliers

Description:
Entities that list, sell, and fulfil products through the marketplace.

Core Accountability:

Product accuracy and representation

Compliance documentation and validity

Fulfilment and delivery obligations

Cooperation with audits, disputes, and investigations

Suppliers are governed participants, not independent platform operators.

3.4 Logistics and Freight Partners

Description:
Third-party service providers involved in shipping, customs handling, or logistics execution.

Core Accountability:

Providing accurate logistics data

Executing shipments in accordance with declared terms

Supplying verifiable status and delivery evidence

These stakeholders do not control pricing, compliance, or buyer relationships.

3.5 Payment Service Providers

Description:
Regulated financial service providers used for payment processing, escrow, and settlement.

Core Accountability:

Secure payment execution

Regulatory compliance within their licensed scope

Transaction reporting and reconciliation support

The platform orchestrates flows but does not assume licensed payment provider obligations.

3.6 Compliance and Certification Authorities

Description:
External bodies responsible for issuing certifications, approvals, or compliance attestations.

Core Accountability:

Issuing authoritative compliance evidence

Maintaining certification validity frameworks

The platform treats these as sources of truth, not internal validators.

3.7 Regulators and Government Authorities

Description:
Public authorities with statutory oversight over aspects of the marketplace’s operation.

Core Accountability:

Regulatory enforcement

Audit and investigation authority

Issuance of legal directives

These stakeholders interact with the platform through evidence, reporting, and lawful disclosure.

3.8 Platform Administrators

Description:
Operational personnel acting on behalf of the marketplace operator.

Core Accountability:

Oversight and supervision

Monitoring system health and compliance

Managing exceptions within governed boundaries

Administrators are supervisors, not rule-breakers or bypass mechanisms.

3.9 System and Automation Actors

Description:
Automated services and system components acting under predefined rules.

Core Accountability:

Executing deterministic logic

Enforcing governance constraints

Producing audit logs and evidence

Automations act only within explicitly defined bounds.

4. Role Separation and Conflict Avoidance

The platform assumes strict separation between:

Buyers and suppliers

Suppliers and administrators

Administrators and payment custody

Automation and discretionary decision-making

No role is permitted to both define rules and benefit from them.

5. Accountability Mapping Principle

Every action taken within the platform must be attributable to:

A specific role

A specific stakeholder class

A legally or operationally accountable entity

Anonymous or unaccountable actions are explicitly disallowed by design.

6. Dependency on Later Documents

This document is foundational to:

Decision Authority Models

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Approval workflows

Audit logging architecture

Incident and breach response design

Those documents must align strictly to this role taxonomy.

7. Change Sensitivity

Changes to stakeholder definitions or role classes are considered structural changes and require:

Governance review

Architectural impact assessment

Formal approval

8. Approval and Locking

Upon approval, this document shall be:

Marked APPROVED

Version-locked

Used as the authoritative role reference

Governed under formal change control
