01.05 — Assumptions, Constraints & Non-Goals

Project Name: RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace
Document Type: Foundational Governance Artefact
Phase: Phase 1 — Master Project Definition
Status: DRAFT (to be approved and locked)
Change Control: Not active (pre-baseline)

1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the assumptions, constraints, and non-goals that govern the design, build, and operation of the RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace.

It answers the question:

What conditions are assumed, what limits exist, and what is explicitly out of scope?

This document exists to eliminate ambiguity, prevent scope creep, and protect governance integrity throughout the project lifecycle.

2. Foundational Assumptions

The following assumptions are treated as true unless formally revised through change control.

2.1 Governance-First Assumption

Governance artefacts precede all technical build activity

Code, UI, and infrastructure are subordinate to approved governance documents

No component may override or bypass governance rules

2.2 Regulated-Marketplace Assumption

The platform operates in regulated environments

Regulatory scrutiny, audits, and evidence requests are expected

All system actions must be defensible and reconstructable

2.3 Audit-Ready by Design Assumption

Audit logging is mandatory, not optional

Evidence is generated automatically and preserved immutably

Retrospective reconstruction must be possible without manual intervention

2.4 Long-Lived Platform Assumption

The platform is designed for multi-year operation

Backward compatibility and data retention matter

Short-term optimisations must not compromise long-term integrity

2.5 Distrust-by-Default Assumption

External actors may act incorrectly, maliciously, or negligently

Internal mistakes are expected and planned for

Controls assume failure, not perfection

3. Structural Constraints

The following constraints are non-negotiable architectural and operational limits.

3.1 Immutable Core Constraint

A defined Core platform exists that cannot be modified casually

Core changes require formal approval, versioning, and audit

Extensions may not weaken or override Core enforcement

3.2 Separation of Concerns Constraint

The platform enforces strict separation between:

Governance and execution

Supervision and operation

Configuration and enforcement

Automation and discretionary decisions

No role, service, or component may collapse these boundaries.

3.3 No Implicit Authority Constraint

Authority must be explicitly granted and logged

Absence of restriction does not imply permission

Default state is denial, not allowance

3.4 No Silent Failure Constraint

Errors must surface, log, and escalate

Silent degradation is disallowed

Failure paths are designed, tested, and auditable

3.5 Evidence Preservation Constraint

Evidence may not be deleted or altered

Retention rules override convenience

Data minimisation does not override audit obligations

4. Operational Constraints
4.1 No Manual Overrides

Administrators may not bypass system rules

Emergency actions are governed, logged, and reviewable

Manual intervention is an exception process, not a shortcut

4.2 No External Trust Without Verification

Third-party inputs are validated

Certifications are verified against rules

Webhooks, APIs, and integrations are treated as untrusted by default

4.3 No Payments Without Integrity

Pricing must be locked before payment

Funds movement must follow defined state transitions

Partial, conditional, or speculative payments are disallowed

5. Explicit Non-Goals

The following are intentionally excluded from this platform.

5.1 Not a General-Purpose Marketplace

The platform is not designed for arbitrary goods

Only governed, defined product categories are permitted

Flexibility does not override compliance

5.2 Not a Payment Institution

The platform does not custody funds

It does not replace licensed financial entities

It orchestrates payments, it does not become one

5.3 Not a Social Platform

No social feeds, messaging networks, or engagement gamification

Communication is transactional, evidentiary, and purposeful

5.4 Not a Supplier-Controlled Platform

Suppliers do not control governance rules

Suppliers do not self-certify compliance

Supplier convenience does not override platform integrity

5.5 Not a Rapid-Iteration Startup Prototype

Speed does not trump correctness

Experiments are governed

“Move fast and break things” is explicitly rejected

5.6 Not a UI-First System

User experience reflects system truth

UI does not invent or obscure system state

Visual polish never precedes enforcement logic

6. Change Sensitivity

Any change to assumptions, constraints, or non-goals:

Is considered foundational

Requires cross-domain review

Triggers architectural reassessment

Must be explicitly approved and recorded

7. Approval and Locking

Upon approval, this document shall be:

Marked APPROVED

Version-locked

Treated as non-negotiable guidance

Enforced via governance and architecture reviews
