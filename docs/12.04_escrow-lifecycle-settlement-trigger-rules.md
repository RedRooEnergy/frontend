12.04 — Escrow Lifecycle & Settlement Trigger Rules
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative lifecycle of escrow funds and the non-negotiable conditions under which settlement is permitted.

Escrow exists to ensure that no funds are released without verified delivery, compliance satisfaction, and audit traceability.

2. Governing Principle

Escrow protects outcomes, not intent.
Funds move only when facts are proven.

No settlement may occur based on trust, time elapsed, or external confirmation alone.

3. Scope

This doctrine governs:

• Escrow creation
• Escrow holding state
• Settlement triggers
• Partial settlement
• Settlement blocking
• Escrow cancellation
• Escrow failure handling

Out of scope:

• Provider-specific escrow mechanics
• Provider internal dispute policies

4. Escrow Definition

An Escrow Record is an immutable system entity that:

• References a locked pricing snapshot
• Holds funds temporarily
• Enforces settlement conditions
• Provides auditable release logic

Escrow is system-governed, not provider-governed.

5. Escrow Creation Preconditions

Escrow may only be created if:

• Pricing snapshot is locked and verified
• Payment provider verification passed
• Snapshot hash validation succeeded
• No compliance or fraud flags exist

Failure of any condition blocks escrow creation.

6. Escrow Binding Rules

Each escrow record must be bound to:

• Pricing snapshot ID
• Pricing snapshot hash
• Order ID
• Buyer ID
• Supplier ID(s)
• Payment provider reference

Bindings are immutable.

7. Escrow Lifecycle States

Escrow must transition through the following states only:

CREATED – Escrow instantiated, funds held

HELD – Awaiting settlement conditions

PARTIALLY_RELEASED – Approved partial settlement

RELEASED – Full settlement completed

BLOCKED – Settlement prevented

CANCELLED – Escrow voided

FAILED – Irrecoverable error

State transitions are strictly controlled.

8. Settlement Trigger Categories

Settlement may only occur when all required trigger categories are satisfied.

Trigger categories include:

• Delivery confirmation
• Compliance verification
• Documentation completeness
• Dispute clearance
• Cooling-off period (where applicable)

Triggers are cumulative, not alternative.

9. Delivery Confirmation Rules

Delivery is confirmed only when:

• Carrier status is verified
• Proof-of-delivery data is recorded
• Timestamp is captured
• No delivery exception exists

Manual overrides are prohibited.

10. Compliance Verification Rules

Compliance must be:

• Verified by system rules
• Based on required certifications
• Confirmed valid at time of delivery

Expired or revoked compliance blocks settlement.

11. Documentation Completeness

Settlement requires:

• All mandatory documents uploaded
• Documents validated
• Documents immutably stored

Missing documents block release.

12. Dispute & Exception Blocking

Settlement is blocked if:

• Any active dispute exists
• Any unresolved exception exists
• Any investigation is ongoing

Dispute resolution precedes settlement.

13. Partial Settlement Rules

Partial settlement is permitted only when:

• Order supports split fulfilment
• Partial delivery is verified
• Compliance satisfied for delivered portion
• Snapshot pricing supports split allocation

Partial settlement must not exceed authorised amounts.

14. Settlement Execution

When triggers are satisfied:

• Escrow release is executed
• Settlement amounts are derived from snapshot
• Split payments are calculated deterministically
• Ledger entries are created

Settlement is atomic and irreversible.

15. Settlement Failure Handling

If settlement fails:

• Funds remain in escrow
• State transitions to BLOCKED or FAILED
• Incident workflow is triggered
• No retry without investigation

Silent retries are forbidden.

16. Escrow Cancellation

Escrow may be cancelled only if:

• Payment is reversed
• Order is cancelled
• Regulatory intervention occurs

Cancellation requires documented justification.

17. Audit & Evidence Requirements

Each escrow must produce:

• Lifecycle timeline
• Trigger satisfaction evidence
• Settlement calculations
• Hash references

Escrow records must be auditor-readable.

18. Security & Abuse Prevention

The system must prevent:

• Early release attempts
• Double settlement
• Provider-triggered release
• Admin override of triggers

Escrow logic is non-bypassable.

19. Change Control

Any change to:

• Lifecycle states
• Trigger conditions
• Release logic

Requires formal governance approval.

20. Enforcement Status

This doctrine is:

• Mandatory
• Runtime-enforced
• Audit-locked

No feature flag may disable escrow enforcement.
