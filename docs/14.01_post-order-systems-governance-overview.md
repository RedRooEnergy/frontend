14.01 — Post-Order Systems Governance Overview
1. Purpose

This document defines the governance framework for all systems that operate after order commitment, ensuring that post-order activities remain compliant, auditable, deterministic, and resistant to manipulation or ambiguity.

Post-order systems are not secondary features; they are continuations of the governed transaction lifecycle.

2. Governing Principle

The transaction does not end at checkout.
Governance persists until final resolution.

Every post-order event must be governed with the same rigor as pricing, payment, and compliance at checkout.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Notifications
• Returns and refunds execution
• Reviews and ratings
• CRM case management
• Evidence pack generation
• SLA monitoring
• Post-delivery dispute handling

Out of scope:

• Marketing automation unrelated to orders
• Supplier internal remediation outside the platform

4. Relationship to Order Lifecycle

Post-order systems operate only on committed orders and must:

• Reference immutable order records
• Reference pricing snapshots
• Reference escrow and settlement state

No post-order system may mutate original order data.

5. Authoritative Data Sources

Post-order systems may only rely on:

• Order records
• Pricing snapshot IDs and hashes
• Fulfilment and delivery events
• Compliance state transitions
• Escrow and settlement records

Derived or inferred data is prohibited.

6. System Boundaries

Post-order systems must not:

• Alter pricing snapshots
• Bypass escrow rules
• Override compliance outcomes
• Modify historical order states

They operate within defined governance boundaries.

7. Event-Driven Architecture

Post-order actions must be triggered by:

• Verified system events
• Explicit buyer or supplier actions
• Compliance or logistics milestones

All triggers must be logged immutably.

8. Notifications Governance (High-Level)

Notifications must:

• Reflect confirmed system state
• Avoid speculative messaging
• Be traceable to triggering events

Notification rules are governed and auditable.

9. Returns & Refund Execution (High-Level)

Execution of returns and refunds must:

• Follow approved case outcomes
• Respect escrow and reconciliation rules
• Generate complete audit trails

Execution logic is separated from request logic.

10. Reviews & Ratings Governance (High-Level)

Reviews and ratings must:

• Be tied to verified purchases
• Respect moderation workflows
• Avoid manipulation or retaliation

Reviews are evidence, not marketing tools.

11. CRM & Case Management (High-Level)

CRM systems must:

• Classify cases deterministically
• Track severity and escalation
• Preserve evidence immutably

Cases are legal artefacts.

12. Evidence Pack Generation

Post-order systems must support:

• Evidence pack assembly
• Cryptographic hashing
• Regulator- and insurer-ready exports

Evidence packs must be reproducible.

13. SLA & Performance Tracking

Where SLAs apply:

• Timers must be deterministic
• Breaches must be logged
• Penalties or actions must be governed

SLA data feeds audit and dispute resolution.

14. Failure & Exception Handling

Post-order system failures must:

• Fail safe
• Preserve state
• Trigger incident workflows

Silent failure is prohibited.

15. Audit & Traceability

Every post-order system must generate:

• Event logs
• Decision records
• Evidence references

Post-order behaviour must be replayable for audit.

16. Security & Abuse Prevention

Post-order systems must resist:

• Duplicate actions
• Evidence tampering
• Case manipulation
• Privilege escalation

Governance applies equally post-order.

17. Change Control

Any change affecting:

• Post-order workflows
• Execution logic
• Evidence handling

Requires formal governance approval.

18. Enforcement Status

This governance is:

• Mandatory
• Runtime-enforced
• Non-bypassable

Administrative shortcuts are prohibited.
