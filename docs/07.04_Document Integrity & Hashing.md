Version: v0.2 DRAFT
Phase: 7 — Core Data Models & Immutability
Upstream Dependencies: 07.03 — Audit Logging & Immutability
Downstream Dependencies: 07.05 — Governance Enforcement Hooks
Status: DRAFT (Lock-Ready)

1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative rules for cryptographic hashing and document integrity within the Immutable Core.

Hashes establish tamper evidence, verification authority, and dispute resolution truth.

2. Hash Generation Authority — 07.04.X

Cryptographic hashes for documents and records governed by the Core are generated by the platform at the moment of:

• Authoritative acceptance, or
• State finalisation

No external system, user, or extension may supply or substitute hashes.

3. Authoritative Hash Record — 07.04.Y

The authoritative hash record is stored in the platform’s immutable audit store.

This record is the sole source of truth for:

• Verification
• Reproduction
• Audit
• Dispute resolution

Any hash not recorded in the audit store is non-authoritative.

4. Immutability Guarantee — 07.04.Z

Once generated and recorded:

• Hashes must never be recalculated
• Hashes must never be replaced
• Hashes must never be retroactively altered

Exceptions are permitted only under approved forensic correction via formal Change Control.
