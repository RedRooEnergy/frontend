11.05 — Shipping Failure, Dispute & Escalation Handling Governance
1. Purpose

This document defines the authoritative governance framework for handling shipping failures, delivery disputes, escalation thresholds, and resolution authority within the marketplace.

It ensures that logistics failures do not compromise commercial integrity, compliance enforcement, or audit readiness.

2. Governing Principle

Shipping failure does not equal commercial failure, and delivery claims do not override system truth.

All shipping outcomes are resolved through governed workflows, not ad-hoc decisions.

3. Scope

This governance applies to:

• Shipment delays
• Lost or damaged goods
• Partial delivery events
• Customs clearance failures
• Carrier non-performance
• Buyer delivery disputes

Out of scope:

• Product quality disputes unrelated to logistics
• Warranty or manufacturer defect claims

4. Failure Classification Model

All shipping failures must be classified as one of:

• Delay — shipment in transit beyond SLA
• Disruption — carrier or route interruption
• Loss — shipment unaccounted for
• Damage — goods compromised in transit
• Customs Hold — regulatory or documentation issue

Each classification drives predefined system behaviour.

5. Source of Truth

The platform shipping engine is the sole authority for:

• Shipment state
• Delivery confirmation
• Escrow eligibility

Carrier assertions are advisory only.

6. Automatic Failure Detection

The system must automatically detect:

• SLA breaches
• Tracking silence beyond thresholds
• Customs dwell time overruns

Detection must not rely on manual reporting.

7. Escalation Triggers

Escalation is triggered when:

• SLA breach exceeds tolerance window
• Carrier reports loss or irrecoverable damage
• Customs clearance exceeds defined limits
• Buyer initiates a delivery dispute

Escalation creates a governed case record.

8. CRM Case Creation

Upon escalation:

• A CRM case is automatically created
• Case severity is assigned
• Linked artefacts are frozen

Manual case creation is not permitted for shipping failures.

9. Evidence Pack Requirements

Each case must include:

• Shipment identifiers
• Tracking history
• Carrier communications
• Customs documentation (if applicable)
• Timestamped system states

Evidence packs must be immutable once created.

10. Authority Model

Resolution authority is strictly defined:

• Suppliers may provide evidence only
• Carriers may provide explanations only
• Administrators may adjudicate logistics outcomes

Buyers cannot override system determinations.

11. Escrow & Financial Controls

During unresolved shipping failure:

• Escrow remains locked
• Funds are not released to suppliers
• Refund eligibility is evaluated but not automatic

No manual fund release is permitted.

12. Partial Delivery Handling

For partial deliveries:

• Delivered items are recorded
• Undelivered items remain open
• Escrow is split only if governance rules permit

Partial confirmation must be explicit.

13. Damage Claims

Damage claims require:

• Buyer-submitted evidence
• Carrier acknowledgement (if available)
• Administrative assessment

Claims are time-bound.

14. Customs Failure Handling

Customs failures must:

• Preserve original declarations
• Trigger compliance review
• Block shipment completion

Duty or classification errors cannot be overridden post-fact.

15. Timelines & SLAs

Each failure class defines:

• Response SLA
• Evidence submission window
• Resolution target

Missed timelines escalate severity.

16. Resolution Outcomes

Permitted outcomes include:

• Delivery confirmation
• Replacement shipment
• Refund approval
• Insurance referral
• Carrier remediation

All outcomes must be recorded with rationale.

17. Audit & Reporting

The system must support:

• Shipping failure metrics
• Carrier performance analysis
• Regulatory reporting

Data must be reproducible.

18. Change Control

Any modification to:

• Failure classifications
• Escalation thresholds
• Authority roles

Requires formal change control approval.
