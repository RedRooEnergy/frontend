02.01 — Document Management System (DMS) Specification

Project Name: RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace
Document Type: Governance Framework Artefact
Phase: Phase 2 — Document Control & Governance
Status: DRAFT (to be approved and locked)
Change Control: Not active (pre-baseline)

1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory Document Management System (DMS) governing all artefacts produced for the RedRoo Energy Multi-Vendor Marketplace.

The DMS is the single source of truth for governance, design, build, operation, and audit evidence.

If an artefact is not in the DMS, it does not exist.

2. Scope

This specification applies to:

Governance documents

Legal and compliance artefacts

Technical specifications

Source-adjacent documentation

Operational procedures

Audit and evidence packs

It applies across all phases, all contributors, and all environments.

3. Core Principles

The DMS operates under the following non-negotiable principles:

Authoritativeness — one canonical location per artefact

Immutability by default — documents are read-only unless revised

Traceability — every change is attributable

Completeness — no undocumented system element

Audit readiness — evidence reproducible at any time

Convenience is subordinate to control.

4. DMS as a System, Not a Folder

The DMS is not merely a directory structure. It is a governed system with:

Defined categories and numbering

Enforced naming standards

Version control rules

Approval workflows

Locking semantics

Tools may assist, but governance defines behaviour.

5. Mandatory Inclusion Rule

Every artefact must meet all of the following:

Assigned a DMS category

Assigned a document ID

Named according to standard

Versioned

Approved before use

Artefacts without these attributes are invalid.

6. Prohibited States

The following are expressly forbidden:

“Working docs” outside the DMS

Unnumbered documents

Overwritten files without version increment

Local-only authoritative copies

Parallel document systems

Violation constitutes governance failure.

7. Relationship to Build Artefacts

For every system component:

A governing document must exist first

The document defines constraints the build enforces

The build may not exceed or contradict governance

Code does not define truth. Documents do.

8. Version Control Relationship

Source control systems (e.g. GitHub) do not replace the DMS.

Git tracks code evolution

The DMS tracks authoritative intent and obligation

Where conflicts arise, the DMS prevails.

9. Access & Authority

Access rules:

Read access is broadly permitted

Write access is restricted

Approval authority is explicitly assigned

Locks cannot be bypassed

Authority follows role, not convenience.

10. Audit & Evidence Role

The DMS must support:

Point-in-time reconstruction

Evidence chain continuity

Independent verification

Regulator-ready exports

If evidence cannot be produced, governance has failed.

11. Enforcement Expectation

The DMS is enforced through:

Process discipline

Tooling where possible

Review gates

Audit checks

Failure to enforce is itself a failure condition.

12. Locking & Authority

Once approved, this document shall be:

Marked APPROVED

Version-locked

Treated as the supreme rule for document handling

Referenced by all subsequent governance artefacts

No exception mechanism exists outside change control.
