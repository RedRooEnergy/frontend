Purpose\n+\n+This SOP defines the only permitted method to temporarily bypass or modify governance enforcement in an emergency, while preserving auditability and rapid restoration to baseline.\n+\n+## 2. Definition of \"Break-Glass\"\n+\n+A Break-Glass event is a time-bounded, documented deviation from governance enforcement required to:\n+\n+- restore platform availability or critical functionality, or\n+- correct a release-blocking defect where immediate remediation cannot be completed within operational tolerance.\n+\n+Break-Glass is not permitted for convenience, routine merges, or to bypass quality gates.\n+\n+## 3. Preconditions (All Required)\n+\n+Before any Break-Glass action is taken:\n+\n+1) Create an issue titled:\n+   - BG-YYYYMMDD-<short-name> — Break-Glass Exception\n+\n+2) The issue must include:\n+   - Incident summary (what is broken, impact)\n+   - Why normal merge process cannot be used\n+   - Exact change requested (branch protection setting or temporary override)\n+   - Start time (UTC) and maximum duration (hard stop)\n+   - Owner (single accountable person)\n+   - Rollback plan\n+   - Remediation plan (how audits will be restored to PASS)\n+\n+3) Approval requirement (minimum):\n+   - Owner approval + one additional approver (or equivalent authority role)\n+\n+## 4. Allowed Break-Glass Actions (Strictly Limited)\n+\n+Allowed actions are limited to:\n+\n+A) Temporarily disabling one required check  \n+B) Temporarily setting `enforce_admins = false` (when regulator-ready is active)  \n+C) Temporarily setting required_status_checks.strict = false  \n+D) Temporarily pausing conversation resolution requirement (only if it blocks urgent merge mechanics)\n+\n+Not allowed:\n+- disabling all checks without explicit board-level instruction\n+- enabling force pushes\n+- disabling protections permanently\n+- merging unrelated changes during the exception window\n+\n+## 5. Execution Steps (Operational)\n+\n+1) Record the current branch protection JSON and attach it to the BG issue.\n+2) Apply the minimal protection change necessary.\n+3) Perform the emergency merge with a PR titled:\n+   - BG-YYYYMMDD-<short-name> — Emergency Merge\n+4) Immediately restore protection settings unless the SOP duration window is still active and necessary.\n+\n+## 6. Maximum Duration\n+\n+Default maximum duration: 4 hours  \n+Maximum duration without escalation: 24 hours\n+\n+Any extension requires explicit approval recorded in the BG issue.\n+\n+## 7. Post-Event Closure (Mandatory)\n+\n+Within 48 hours of the Break-Glass event ending:\n+\n+1) Restore full governance enforcement.\n+2) Run and record PASS results for all required audits.\n+3) Create a closure note in the BG issue:\n+   - What happened\n+   - What was changed\n+   - What was merged\n+   - Proof that governance is restored (links to runs/tags if applicable)\n+4) Open follow-up remediation issues to prevent recurrence.\n+\n+## 8. Evidence Requirements\n+\n+Every Break-Glass event must produce a minimal evidence pack:\n+\n+- Link to the BG issue\n+- Link to PR(s)\n+- Branch protection \"before\" and \"after\" JSON\n+- Post-restoration audit PASS evidence\n+\n+## 9.

Purpose\n+\n+This declaration defines the enforced governance baseline for the RedRooEnergy frontend platform.  \n+It provides investors a verifiable, immutable reference for:\n+\n+- Control scope (what is governed)\n+- Control enforcement (what blocks merges)\n+- Evidence (what is immutable and hash-verifiable)\n+- Exception handling (how deviations are controlled)\n+- The planned progression to regulator-ready posture\n+\n+This baseline is designed to prevent silent control drift.\n+\n+## 2. Baseline Identity (Immutable References)\n+\n+### 2.1 Consolidated governance release tag (authoritative)\n+- Tag: marketplace-governance-v1.0.0  \n+- Meaning: consolidated, enforced governance baseline across Buyer + Freight + Installer audits (PASS-1 PASS)\n+\n+### 2.2 Subsystem release tags (component baselines)\n+- Installer Onboarding: installer-onboarding-v1.0.0  \n+- Freight & Customs: freight-customs-audit-v1.0.0  \n+- Buyer Onboarding: buyer-onboarding-audit-v1.0.0  \n+\n+Each subsystem tag references:\n+- PASS-1 status at freeze time\n+- runId\n+- scorecard path\n+- PDF path\n+- SHA-256 path\n+- CI posture note\n+\n+## 3. Enforced Controls (What is governed)\n+\n+The governance baseline is enforced via three deterministic audit suites:\n+\n+1) Installer Onboarding Audit  \n+2) Freight & Customs Audit  \n+3) Buyer Onboarding Audit  \n+\n+These suites verify, at minimum:\n+- Role gating and isolation\n+- Deterministic onboarding and eligibility controls\n+- Deterministic order invariants (pricing snapshot + timeline)\n+- Deterministic escrow/hold observability (where in scope)\n+- Deterministic evidence projection and non-leakage\n+- Deterministic admin replay/traceability (where in scope)\n+- Evidence artefacts (HTML → Chromium → PDF + SHA-256) for each run\n+\n+## 4. Merge Enforcement (Branch Protection Baseline)\n+\n+Branch protection on `main` is configured such that merges require:\n+\n+- Required status checks (strict = true):\n+  - Buyer Onboarding Audit (Blocking)\n+  - Freight & Customs Audit (Blocking)\n+  - Installer Onboarding Audit (Blocking)\n+\n+- Required conversation resolution: true  \n+- Force pushes: false  \n+- Deletions: false  \n+- Admin bypass: currently permitted (enforce_admins = false)\n+\n+This configuration constitutes \"Investor-grade enforcement\": control drift is blocked under normal operations.\n+\n+## 5. Evidence and Immutability Rules\n+\n+For each audit run, the evidence outputs are:\n+\n+- JSON scorecard (per-check outcomes + overall)\n+- One-page PDF summary generated from deterministic HTML\n+- SHA-256 hash file for the PDF\n+\n+Evidence is treated as immutable by convention:\n+- Historical artefacts are not overwritten.\n+- Tags pin the baseline state and reference the evidence artefacts.\n+\n+## 6. Exception Handling (Break-Glass SOP)\n+\n+Exceptions are permitted only under controlled conditions and must follow the Break-Glass procedure defined in:\n+- BREAK_GLASS_EXCEPTION_SOP.md\n+\n+No exception may be executed without:\n+- a documented rationale\n+- a time-bounded reversion plan\n+- a follow-up remediation and re-enablement path\n+\n+## 7. Planned Transition to Regulator-Ready Posture\n+\n+Regulator-ready posture requires two upgrades:\n+\n+1) Non-bypassable enforcement:\n+   - Set branch protection `enforce_admins = true` on main\n+   - Admins cannot merge without all required checks passing\n+\n+2) Formal exception/change-control policy:\n+   - Adopt the Break-Glass SOP as mandatory policy\n+   - Require recorded approvals and post-incident closure documentation\n+\n+Timing rule:\n+- After one stable operating cycle (no emergency exceptions; consistent PASS outcomes), enable enforce_admins = true and issue a regulator-ready declaration.\n+\n+## 8. Declaration\n+\n+This governance baseline is active and enforced on the repository's main branch.  \n+Any deviation from this baseline must follow the Break-Glass SOP or formal change
