# EXT-09 — Implementation Authorised

Extension: EXT-09 — Compliance Authority Experience & Decision Workflows
Status: AUTHORISED
Mode: GOVERNANCE LOCKED → IMPLEMENTATION PERMITTED

Implementation may now proceed strictly within the
constraints defined by EXTENSION_LOCK.md.

All changes from this point forward require:
- Reference to this authorisation
- Compliance with locked governance artefacts
- Change Control (CCR) for any deviation

No implementation work may begin prior to this authorisation.
