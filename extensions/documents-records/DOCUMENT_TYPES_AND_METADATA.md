# EXT-14 — Document Types, Evidence Classes & Metadata Model

Status: GOVERNANCE DRAFT
Extension: EXT-14 — Documents, Evidence & Records Portal
Implementation: NOT AUTHORIZED

## Purpose

This document defines the authorised document and evidence types
and the mandatory metadata required for all records managed under EXT-14.

No document may exist in the system without compliant metadata.

## Core Principles

- Append-only records
- Mandatory metadata on creation
- Metadata is immutable once stored
- Document content may never be edited or replaced
- Evidence is classified and traceable

## Document Categories

### Commercial & Transactional
Examples:
- Invoices
- Receipts
- Purchase confirmations
- Settlement statements

### Compliance & Regulatory
Examples:
- Certificates
- Test reports
- Declarations of conformity
- Audit findings

### Logistics & Operations
Examples:
- Bills of lading
- Shipping labels
- Delivery confirmations
- Damage reports

### Financial & Dispute
Examples:
- Escrow records
- Refund requests
- Dispute evidence
- Adjustment justifications

### Governance & System
Examples:
- Policy acknowledgements
- Regulatory notices
- System-generated records
- Legal correspondence

## Evidence Classes

Evidence is classified as one of the following:

- PRIMARY_EVIDENCE  
  (Direct proof such as certificates, signed documents)

- SUPPORTING_EVIDENCE  
  (Photographs, supplementary reports, attachments)

- SYSTEM_GENERATED  
  (Logs, snapshots, automated outputs)

- USER_ATTESTATION  
  (Signed declarations or acknowledgements)

## Mandatory Metadata Fields

Every document or evidence record MUST include:

- Record ID (system-generated)
- Document / Evidence Type
- Evidence Class
- Related Entity Type (Order, Case, Shipment, Finance Case, etc.)
- Related Entity ID
- Uploaded / Generated By (identity or system)
- Upload Source (UI / API / SYSTEM)
- Created Timestamp (UTC)
- Content Hash / Checksum
- Retention Category
- Legal Hold Flag (if applicable)

## Optional Metadata (Governed)

Optional metadata MAY include:
- Description (template-bound only)
- Reference numbers
- Language
- Jurisdiction

Free-form metadata is prohibited.

## Prohibited Behaviour

The system MUST NOT allow:
- Documents without mandatory metadata
- Metadata modification after creation
- Record deletion or replacement
- Evidence reclassification after storage

## Audit & Traceability

All document lifecycle events MUST emit audit events:
- DOCUMENT_CREATED
- DOCUMENT_LINKED
- DOCUMENT_ACCESSED
- DOCUMENT_EXPORTED

Audit records are immutable and regulator-visible.

## Out of Scope

- File storage backends
- Virus scanning and content inspection
- OCR or document processing
- Content redaction

These are addressed in Core or later implementation phases.
