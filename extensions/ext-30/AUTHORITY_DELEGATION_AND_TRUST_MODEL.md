# EXT-30 — Authority, Delegation & Trust Model

Status: GOVERNANCE DRAFT  
Extension: EXT-30 — Marketing Intelligence, Creative & Campaign Studio  
Implementation: NOT AUTHORIZED

## Purpose

Defines authority and trust boundaries.

## Authority Source Doctrine

Authority derives only from:
- Core identity and role enforcement
- Explicit delegation approved by Core

EXT-30 is not an authority source.

## Delegation Constraints

Delegation must be explicit, scoped, and time-bound.

## Trust Boundaries

Trust applies only to:
- Verified users
- Approved content sources
- Documented permissions

## Fail-Closed Behaviour

Unclear authority results in denial.

## Audit Requirements

Authority checks MUST be auditable.

## Out of Scope

- Role schemas
- Identity verification


Validation Checklist:

Authority constrained  
Trust enforced  
Fail-closed defined
