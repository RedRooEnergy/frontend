# EXT-28 — Scope Definition & Explicit Boundaries

Status: GOVERNANCE DRAFT  
Extension: EXT-28 — [EXTENSION NAME – TO BE CONFIRMED]  
Implementation: NOT AUTHORIZED

## Purpose

This document defines the explicit scope boundaries,
permitted activities, and prohibited behaviours
governing EXT-28.

EXT-28 must operate only within its approved scope.

## In-Scope Definition

EXT-28 scope includes ONLY:
- Activities explicitly required to fulfil the approved mandate
- Extension-scoped coordination or reference functions
- Interactions explicitly permitted by Core

Any activity not listed is out of scope.

## Explicit Exclusions

EXT-28 MUST NOT:
- Operate outside its mandate
- Introduce new system responsibilities
- Extend authority beyond approved bounds
- Interact with unauthorised entities or data

Exclusions are mandatory constraints.

## Boundary Conditions

EXT-28 boundaries are enforced by:
- Governance documentation
- Core permission and authority checks
- Audit and trace requirements

Boundary enforcement is non-optional.

## No Scope Expansion Rule

EXT-28 MUST NOT:
- Expand scope through configuration
- Accumulate scope through iteration
- Assume future capabilities

Scope expansion requires formal change control.

## Interaction Limits

EXT-28 may interact ONLY with:
- Core services explicitly authorised
- External authorities explicitly recognised by Core

Implicit or inferred interactions are prohibited.

## Cross-Extension Isolation

EXT-28 MUST:
- Remain isolated from other extensions
- Avoid shared state or dependencies
- Prevent cross-extension coupling

Isolation is mandatory.

## Failure on Boundary Ambiguity

If scope applicability is unclear:
- Action MUST be denied
- Escalation MUST occur
- No provisional operation is allowed

Fail-open behaviour is prohibited.

## Audit Requirements

The following MUST be auditable:
- Scope boundary checks
- Denied out-of-scope actions
- Escalation events

Audit records are immutable.

## Out of Scope

- Technical enforcement mechanisms
- Runtime configuration
- Operational procedures
- User-facing explanations

These are governed by Core.
