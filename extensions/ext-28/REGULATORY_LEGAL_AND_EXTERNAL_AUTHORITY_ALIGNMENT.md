# EXT-28 — Regulatory, Legal & External Authority Alignment

Status: GOVERNANCE DRAFT  
Extension: EXT-28 — [EXTENSION NAME – TO BE CONFIRMED]  
Implementation: NOT AUTHORIZED

## Purpose

This document defines mandatory alignment requirements
between EXT-28 and applicable regulatory, legal, and
external authority obligations.

EXT-28 must operate only within formally recognised
legal and regulatory boundaries.

## Regulatory Alignment Doctrine

EXT-28 MUST:
- Operate consistently with all applicable laws
- Respect jurisdictional boundaries
- Defer interpretation to authorised legal authorities

EXT-28 does not interpret law.

## External Authority Recognition

Recognised external authorities include:
- Regulators designated by Core
- Courts and tribunals
- Accredited certification bodies
- Government agencies

EXT-28 MUST act only on authority explicitly recognised by Core.

## Authority Precedence

When authority sources conflict:
- Core determinations prevail
- External authority instructions are deferred
- EXT-28 takes no independent position

Conflict resolution is outside EXT-28 scope.

## Compliance Dependency Rule

EXT-28 MUST NOT:
- Assume compliance status
- Certify legal conformity
- Override compliance decisions
- Substitute for regulated actors

Compliance decisions remain external.

## Jurisdictional Constraints

EXT-28 MUST:
- Respect geographic and legal jurisdiction limits
- Deny actions outside authorised jurisdictions
- Avoid cross-jurisdiction inference

Jurisdiction uncertainty results in denial.

## Evidence Handling for Legal Contexts

EXT-28 MAY:
- Reference legally relevant evidence
- Link evidence to legal workflows

EXT-28 MUST NOT:
- Alter legal evidence
- Redact or summarise legal records
- Provide legal opinions

## Regulatory Change Handling

EXT-28 MUST NOT:
- Self-adjust to regulatory changes
- Implement inferred policy updates
- Apply provisional interpretations

All regulatory updates require Core governance action.

## Enforcement Separation

EXT-28 MUST NOT:
- Enforce legal penalties
- Initiate regulatory reporting
- Execute compliance sanctions

EXT-28 surfaces only governed outcomes.

## Audit Requirements

The following MUST be auditable:
- External authority references
- Jurisdiction-based denials
- Legal escalation events

Audit records are immutable.

## Out of Scope

- Legal advice generation
- Regulatory reporting automation
- Compliance certification logic
- Policy interpretation engines

These are governed by Core.
