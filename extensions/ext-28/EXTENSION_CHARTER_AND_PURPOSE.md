# EXT-28 — Extension Charter & Purpose

Status: GOVERNANCE DRAFT  
Extension: EXT-28 — [EXTENSION NAME – TO BE CONFIRMED]  
Implementation: NOT AUTHORIZED

## Purpose

This document formally defines the charter, intent,
and governance boundaries of EXT-28.

EXT-28 exists solely to fulfil its explicitly approved
mandate and must not expand beyond it.

## Extension Charter

EXT-28 is a governed extension of the RedRooEnergy
platform, defined exclusively by this charter and
the governance artefacts that follow.

EXT-28:
- Is optional
- Is non-Core
- Is subordinate to all Core governance
- Has no implied authority, autonomy, or permanence

## Mandate Definition

The mandate of EXT-28 is to:
- [MANDATE TO BE DEFINED]
- [SECONDARY OBJECTIVE IF APPLICABLE]

Any activity not explicitly included in this mandate
is prohibited.

## Explicit Non-Objectives

EXT-28 MUST NOT:
- Modify or override Core behaviour
- Replace Core controls or governance
- Act as a system of record
- Introduce new authority domains
- Make legal, regulatory, or compliance determinations

Non-objectives are binding constraints.

## Governance Dependency

EXT-28 is governed by:
- The Immutable Core
- The Extensions Governance Framework
- Approved EXT-28 governance artefacts

EXT-28 has no independent governance authority.

## Boundary Declaration

EXT-28 boundaries are defined by:
- Its approved mandate
- Explicit permissions granted by Core
- Documented interaction limits

Boundary expansion requires formal change control.

## Non-Operational Status

At this stage:
- EXT-28 is governance-only
- No implementation is authorised
- No operational capability exists

Implementation without approval is prohibited.

## Audit Expectation

All future EXT-28 activity MUST:
- Be auditable
- Be traceable to this charter
- Comply with all Core audit doctrines

Audit requirements are non-negotiable.

## Out of Scope

- Technical design
- Data models
- Process flows
- User interfaces
- Automation logic

These will be governed by subsequent steps.
