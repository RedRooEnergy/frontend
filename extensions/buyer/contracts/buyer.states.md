# Buyer-Visible States — Contract Definition

This document defines buyer-visible representations of system state.

Buyer-visible states are projections only.
They must never diverge from Core truth.

Examples:
- ORDER_CREATED
- PAYMENT_HELD_IN_ESCROW
- COMPLIANCE_VERIFIED
- DISPATCHED
- COMPLETED

Buyer views do not infer, calculate, or modify state.
