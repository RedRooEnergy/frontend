# Buyer Events — Contract Definition

This document defines buyer-originated events that MUST be emitted for audit.

Events are declarative only at this stage.

Examples (non-exhaustive):
- BUYER_VIEW_ORDER
- BUYER_DOWNLOAD_DOCUMENT
- BUYER_VIEW_COMPLIANCE_STATUS
- BUYER_VIEW_PAYMENT_STATE

No event causes state mutation.
All events are observational.
