# EXT-21 — Extension Lock & Implementation Authorisation

Status: GOVERNANCE DRAFT  
Extension: EXT-21 — [EXTENSION NAME – TO BE CONFIRMED]  
Implementation: NOT AUTHORIZED

## Purpose

This document formally locks the EXT-21 governance baseline and defines
the non-negotiable conditions that must be satisfied before any
implementation activity is authorised.

No implementation may proceed without explicit approval.

## Governance Lock Declaration

Once EXT-21 governance is approved:
- Scope boundaries are frozen
- Authority separation is immutable
- Integration constraints are locked
- Failure and escalation rules are fixed

Any deviation requires formal change control.

## Lock Scope

This lock applies to:
- Functional scope and capability limits
- Authority and decision boundaries
- Data ownership and evidence handling
- Failure handling and escalation
- Core integration rules
- Auth and scope enforcement

This lock does NOT grant implementation permission.

## Implementation Authorisation Gate

Implementation of EXT-21 is authorised ONLY when ALL of the following
conditions are met:

- Core platform governance is locked
- EXT-21 governance steps are complete
- Audit and security doctrines are approved
- Change control framework is active
- Formal authorisation record exists

Partial or implied authorisation is prohibited.

## Prohibited Actions Prior to Authorisation

Before authorisation, EXT-21 MUST NOT:
- Create API routes
- Define database schemas
- Write business logic
- Build UI components
- Integrate external services
- Handle financial or compliance actions

Any such activity constitutes a governance breach.

## Authority Separation Confirmation

EXT-21:
- Coordinates information
- Surfaces state
- Records metadata
- Emits audit events

EXT-21 does NOT:
- Make decisions
- Execute authority
- Override Core enforcement
- Perform irreversible actions

All authority remains external or within Core.

## Version Lock Rules

- Governance version is immutable once approved
- All changes require change control
- Historical versions must be preserved
- Rollback applies only to locked versions

## Change Control Trigger

Change control is mandatory if:
- Scope expands
- Capabilities change
- New roles or actors are introduced
- New integrations are proposed
- Authority boundaries are modified

No emergency exception exists.

## Implementation Readiness Declaration

Implementation readiness exists ONLY when:
- This document is APPROVED
- Implementation status is set to AUTHORIZED
- Start of implementation is formally recorded

Silence does not imply consent.

## Audit Requirements

The following MUST be auditable:
- Governance lock approval
- Implementation authorisation
- Any premature implementation attempt

Audit records are immutable.

## Out of Scope

- Implementation architecture
- Technical design
- UI/UX decisions
- Performance considerations

These occur only after authorisation.
