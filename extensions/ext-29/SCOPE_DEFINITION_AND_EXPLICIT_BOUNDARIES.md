# EXT-29 — Scope Definition & Explicit Boundaries

Status: GOVERNANCE DRAFT  
Extension: EXT-29 — China Supplier Discovery, Prospecting & Outreach System  
Implementation: NOT AUTHORIZED

## Purpose

This document defines the explicit scope, inclusions,
exclusions, and non-negotiable boundaries governing
EXT-29.

EXT-29 must operate strictly as a prospect discovery
and engagement extension and must not expand into
supplier authority or Core responsibilities.

## In-Scope Definition

EXT-29 scope includes ONLY the following activities:

- Discovery and cataloguing of Chinese renewable energy manufacturers
- Prospect company and contact data capture
- Classification by geography, size, product categories, and signals
- Recording source evidence for prospect discovery
- Governed outbound communication to prospects
- Recording inbound replies and engagement signals
- Issuing controlled invitations into Core supplier onboarding

All in-scope activity must remain pre-onboarding.

## Explicit Exclusions

EXT-29 MUST NOT:

- Create, modify, or activate suppliers in Core
- Approve or validate products, factories, or certifications
- Act as the authoritative system of record for suppliers
- Bypass Core onboarding, compliance, or approval flows
- Perform uncontrolled scraping or mass data harvesting
- Send outreach without consent governance
- Engage in deceptive or undisclosed marketing practices

These exclusions are binding constraints.

## Data Boundary Declaration

EXT-29 may manage ONLY:

- Prospect-level company records
- Prospect-level contact records
- Source evidence and discovery metadata
- Engagement and communication records
- Consent and suppression status
- Segmentation and scoring attributes

Once a prospect enters Core onboarding, Core becomes
authoritative and EXT-29 retains reference-only links.

## Communication Scope

EXT-29 MAY:

- Send governed email communications
- Distribute approved brochures and materials
- Record replies and engagement outcomes

EXT-29 MUST NOT:

- Send ungoverned bulk messages
- Ignore opt-out or suppression rules
- Escalate communication frequency beyond approved limits

Communication scope is governed by consent doctrine.

## Geographic Scope

EXT-29 scope is limited to:

- Manufacturers and factories located within China
- China-based export-oriented renewable energy producers

Expansion to other regions requires formal change control.

## Platform & Source Scope

EXT-29 MAY reference:

- Trade directories and marketplaces
- Trade show and exhibition lists
- Referrals and direct introductions
- Publicly available manufacturer information

EXT-29 MUST record source evidence and confidence level
for all prospect entries.

## No Scope Expansion Rule

EXT-29 MUST NOT:

- Expand scope through configuration
- Accumulate new responsibilities incrementally
- Assume future authority based on usage

Scope expansion requires formal governance change.

## Failure on Boundary Ambiguity

If scope applicability is unclear:

- Action MUST be denied
- Outreach MUST not proceed
- Escalation MUST occur

Fail-open behaviour is prohibited.

## Audit Requirements

The following MUST be auditable:

- Prospect creation and updates
- Source evidence capture
- Outreach actions and replies
- Consent and suppression changes
- Scope-based denials

Audit records are immutable.

## Out of Scope

- Data enrichment automation
- Technical scraping tools
- CRM workflow automation
- Messaging infrastructure design
- Analytics and reporting engines

These are governed by subsequent steps.

STOP POINT

Next step

When ready, reply with one line only:

“Proceed with EXT-29 STEP 03 — Authority, Delegation & Trust Model”

I will then define authority, delegation, and trust boundaries specifically for prospecting, consent, and outreach.
