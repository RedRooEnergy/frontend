# EXT-29 — Extension Charter & Purpose

Status: GOVERNANCE DRAFT  
Extension: EXT-29 — China Supplier Discovery, Prospecting & Outreach System  
Implementation: NOT AUTHORIZED

## Purpose

This document defines the charter, purpose, and non-negotiable
governance boundaries for EXT-29.

EXT-29 establishes a governed system for discovering, classifying,
and engaging Chinese renewable energy manufacturers for the purpose
of inviting them into the RedRooEnergy supplier onboarding pipeline.

EXT-29 is a prospecting and engagement extension only. It must not
create, modify, or authoritatively manage suppliers within Core.

## Extension Charter

EXT-29 is a standalone but Core-integrated extension that enables:

- Discovery of Chinese renewable energy manufacturers
- Structured prospect data capture and classification
- Governed outbound communication and engagement
- Controlled handover into Core supplier onboarding

EXT-29:
- Is optional
- Is non-Core
- Is subordinate to all Core governance
- Has no authority to bypass onboarding, compliance, or approval gates

## Mandate Definition

The mandate of EXT-29 is to:

- Identify and catalogue Chinese renewable energy manufacturers
- Maintain a prospect database for outreach and qualification
- Support compliant email and digital outreach campaigns
- Segment prospects by geography, size, product category, and signals
- Invite qualified prospects into the official RedRooEnergy onboarding process

EXT-29 must terminate its authority at the point of onboarding
invitation. Core assumes authority thereafter.

## Explicit Non-Objectives

EXT-29 MUST NOT:

- Create or activate suppliers in Core
- Approve products or certifications
- Act as a system of record for suppliers
- Replace Core onboarding or compliance systems
- Enforce legal or regulatory determinations
- Perform uncontrolled scraping or mass outreach

Non-objectives are binding constraints.

## Governance Dependency

EXT-29 is governed by:

- The Immutable Core
- The Extensions Governance Framework
- Core privacy, audit, and consent doctrines
- Approved EXT-29 governance artefacts

EXT-29 has no independent governance authority.

## Boundary Declaration

EXT-29 boundaries are defined by:

- Prospect-only data ownership
- Explicit permission from Core for integration points
- Documented handover mechanisms into onboarding
- Consent and communication governance requirements

Any boundary expansion requires formal change control.

## Non-Operational Status

At this stage:

- EXT-29 is governance-only
- No data ingestion is authorised
- No outreach is authorised
- No integration is authorised

Any operational activity prior to approval is prohibited.

## Audit Expectation

All future EXT-29 activity MUST:

- Be auditable end-to-end
- Record source evidence and engagement actions
- Preserve immutable logs for outreach and consent
- Comply with Core audit and evidence doctrine

Audit requirements are non-negotiable.

## Out of Scope

- Technical architecture
- Data schemas
- Scraping or enrichment logic
- Outreach automation
- UI or workflow design

These are governed by subsequent steps.

What happens next

Do not proceed automatically.

When you are ready, reply with one line only:

“Proceed with EXT-29 STEP 02 — Scope Definition & Explicit Boundaries”

I will then design STEP 02 specifically around:

Prospect vs supplier boundaries

Data collection limits

Outreach and consent scope

Geographic and platform sourcing limits
