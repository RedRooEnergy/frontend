# EXT-25 — Extension Charter & Scope Definition

Status: GOVERNANCE DRAFT  
Extension: EXT-25 — [EXTENSION NAME – TO BE CONFIRMED]  
Implementation: NOT AUTHORIZED

## Purpose

This document establishes EXT-25 as a governed, optional extension
operating alongside the Immutable Core.

EXT-25 provides additional, non-core capability without modifying,
bypassing, or weakening Core controls.

## Architectural Position

EXT-25 is:
- An independent extension
- Optional to Core operation
- Fully removable
- Independently versioned and governed

EXT-25 is NOT part of the Immutable Core.

## Scope Definition

EXT-25 scope is limited to:
- Explicitly defined extension-specific functionality
- Coordination, aggregation, or enhancement logic only
- Operations within strictly approved boundaries

EXT-25 MUST NOT assume Core authority.

## Explicit Non-Goals

EXT-25 does NOT:
- Introduce new Core roles
- Override Core decisions
- Execute financial authority
- Alter compliance outcomes
- Modify Core data models or controls

Any such behaviour is prohibited.

## Authority Separation

EXT-25 may coordinate, record, or surface information.

EXT-25 may NOT:
- Decide outcomes
- Approve actions
- Execute irreversible operations

All authority remains with Core or designated external authorities.

## Dependency Rules

EXT-25:
- Depends on Core only through approved interfaces
- Must not be depended upon by Core
- Must not introduce circular dependencies

## Extension Independence

If EXT-25 is disabled or removed:
- Core continues uninterrupted
- Other extensions remain unaffected
- Historical data remains intact

EXT-25 must fail closed.

## Versioning Declaration

EXT-25 will be:
- Independently versioned
- Locked once approved
- Governed under formal change control

Informal evolution is prohibited.

## Out of Scope

- Implementation design
- UI/UX decisions
- API routes
- Database schemas
- Performance optimisation

These occur only after authorisation.
