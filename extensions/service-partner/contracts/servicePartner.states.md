# Service Partner–Visible States — Contract Definition

This document defines Service Partner–visible projections of Core state.

Service Partners observe but do not control state.

Examples:
- TASK_ASSIGNED
- TASK_ACKNOWLEDGED
- TASK_IN_PROGRESS
- EVIDENCE_SUBMITTED
- TASK_COMPLETED

States are projections only and must match Core truth.
