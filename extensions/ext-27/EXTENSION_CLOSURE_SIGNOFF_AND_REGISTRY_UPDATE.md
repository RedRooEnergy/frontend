# EXT-27 — Extension Closure, Sign-Off & Registry Update

Status: GOVERNANCE DRAFT  
Extension: EXT-27 — [EXTENSION NAME – TO BE CONFIRMED]  
Implementation: NOT AUTHORIZED

## Purpose

This document defines mandatory closure conditions,
formal sign-off requirements, and registry update
rules governing EXT-27.

EXT-27 must not be treated as complete without
formal closure and registry acknowledgement.

## Closure Preconditions

EXT-27 may be closed ONLY when:
- All EXT-27 governance documents are completed
- All documents are reviewed and approved
- No unresolved governance gaps remain
- Implementation status remains NOT AUTHORIZED

Partial closure is prohibited.

## Sign-Off Authority

Formal closure requires sign-off from:
- Core governance authority
- Extension registry custodian
- Any designated oversight authority

Sign-off must be explicit and recorded.

## Sign-Off Record

The sign-off record MUST include:
- Extension ID and name
- Document list and versions
- Approval date
- Authorising parties

Unsigned closure is invalid.

## Registry Update Rules

Upon sign-off:
- EXTENSIONS_REGISTRY.md MUST be updated
- EXT-27 status MUST be set to GOVERNANCE COMPLETE
- Implementation authorisation MUST remain false

Registry accuracy is mandatory.

## Non-Operational Declaration

Closure of EXT-27 signifies:
- Governance definition complete
- No operational capability granted
- No implicit approval to implement

Operational use remains prohibited until separately authorised.

## Post-Closure Change Control

After closure:
- Any change requires formal change control
- All modifications MUST reopen the extension
- Registry status MUST be updated accordingly

Silent edits are prohibited.

## Archival Discipline

Closed governance artefacts MUST:
- Remain immutable
- Be retained according to Core policy
- Be available for audit and review

Deletion or modification is prohibited.

## Audit Requirements

The following MUST be auditable:
- Closure approval
- Sign-off records
- Registry updates
- Post-closure change events

Audit records are immutable.

## Out of Scope

- Implementation approval
- Deployment authorisation
- Operational readiness assessment
- Runtime enablement

These are governed by Core.
