Status: GOVERNANCE DRAFT  
Extension: EXT-27 — [EXTENSION NAME – TO BE CONFIRMED]  
Implementation: NOT AUTHORIZED

## Purpose

This document defines mandatory documentation,
transparency boundaries, and operator obligations
governing EXT-27.

EXT-27 must be fully explainable without exposing
internal logic or sensitive controls.

## Documentation Requirements

EXT-27 MUST have:
- A complete governance document set
- Clear scope and boundary definitions
- Explicit non-capabilities and prohibitions
- Versioned and approved documentation

Undocumented behaviour is prohibited.

## Accuracy & Currency

All EXT-27 documentation MUST:
- Reflect the approved implementation
- Be kept current with governance changes
- Be reviewed and approved prior to enablement

Stale or misleading documentation is a governance breach.

## Transparency Boundaries

EXT-27 MAY disclose:
- Whether an action is permitted or denied
- That governance enforcement has occurred
- That escalation is required

EXT-27 MUST NOT disclose:
- Internal decision logic
- Policy interpretation rules
- Security or enforcement mechanisms

Transparency is bounded and deliberate.

## Operator Obligations

Operators responsible for EXT-27 MUST:
- Maintain approved documentation
- Ensure ongoing governance compliance
- Monitor audit outputs
- Initiate suspension when required

Operator discretion must not override governance.

## Change Disclosure

Any change to EXT-27 MUST:
- Be documented prior to implementation
- Reference the governing approval
- Update all affected documentation artefacts

Silent or undocumented changes are prohibited.

## User Communication Discipline

EXT-27 communications MUST:
- Be factual and non-diagnostic
- Avoid advisory or corrective guidance
- Defer explanation to authorised channels

EXT-27 does not provide instructions.

## Training & Knowledge Transfer

EXT-27 MUST NOT:
- Require specialised operator training
- Depend on undocumented procedures
- Rely on institutional memory

All required knowledge must be documented.

## Audit Requirements

The following MUST be auditable:
- Documentation approvals
- Documentation updates
- Operator acknowledgement of obligations

Audit records are immutable.

## Out of Scope

- End-user help content
- UX copywriting
- Training programs
- Support workflows

These are governed by Core.
