  "onboarding.i18n.body": "Bilingual (English / Chinese) support across all Supplier Dashboard pages in the RedRooEnergy (RRE) Marketplace.\nThis is written as a developer directive, not a discussion.\n\nCODEX DIRECTIVE\nFeature: Bilingual Supplier Dashboard (English / Chinese)\nScope: All supplier-facing pages, components, forms, help text, onboarding content, validation messages, and system notices\nLanguages:\n* English (en) – default\n* Simplified Chinese (zh-CN)\n\n1. CORE REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\n1. Every supplier page must support English and Chinese.\n2. Language selection must be user-controlled.\n3. Language preference must be persisted per supplier user.\n4. No hard-coded English strings are permitted in supplier UI.\n5. Language switching must not reload or reset form state.\n6. English remains the authoritative legal language where required, but Chinese must be fully readable everywhere.\n\n2. LANGUAGE SWITCH UI (SUPPLIER DASHBOARD)\nPlacement\n* Top-right of Supplier Dashboard header\n* Visible on all supplier pages\nUI Control\n* Toggle or dropdown with:\n    * EN (English)\n    * 中文 (简体中文)\nBehaviour\n* Switching language:\n    * Updates all visible text immediately\n    * Does NOT reload the page\n    * Does NOT clear form inputs\n* Selected language:\n    * Saved to user profile\n    * Restored automatically on next login\n\n3. TECHNICAL APPROACH (REQUIRED PATTERN)\nA. Centralised i18n System\nCodex must implement a key-based internationalisation system, for example:\n* i18n / next-intl / equivalent\n* No inline literals in JSX/TSX\nPattern:\n* Every UI string → translation key\n* Keys are stable and human-readable\n* Text is loaded from language dictionaries\n\n4. TRANSLATION FILE STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)\nCodex must create language resource files as follows:\n\n/locales/\n  /en/\n    supplier.json\n  /zh-CN/\n    supplier.json\nAll supplier-related text lives in these files only.\n\n5. TRANSLATION KEY DESIGN (EXAMPLE)\nExample Keys (supplier.json)\n\n{\n  \"dashboard.welcome.title\": \"Welcome to the RedRooEnergy Supplier Dashboard\",\n  \"dashboard.welcome.subtitle\": \"Your governed workspace for compliant product submission and sales\",\n\n  \"products.tabs.all\": \"Product Catalogue\",\n  \"products.tabs.drafts\": \"New Products (Drafts)\",\n  \"products.tabs.review\": \"Products Under Review\",\n  \"products.tabs.approved\": \"Approved Products\",\n  \"products.tabs.rejected\": \"Rejected / Suspended Products\",\n\n  \"product.create.button\": \"Create New Product\",\n  \"product.category.select\": \"Select Product Category\",\n\n  \"product.images.title\": \"Product Images\",\n  \"product.images.requirement\": \"Exactly six (6) clear product images are required\",\n\n  \"approval.supplier.title\": \"Supplier Internal Approval\",\n  \"approval.supplier.button\": \"Approve Product for Submission\",\n\n  \"partner.select.title\": \"Select Compliance & Certification Partner\",\n  \"partner.review.status.pending\": \"Partner review pending\",\n  \"partner.review.status.pass\": \"Partner review passed\",\n  \"partner.review.status.fail\": \"Partner review failed\"\n}\n\nChinese Version (zh-CN/supplier.json)\n\n{\n  \"dashboard.welcome.title\": \"欢迎使用 RedRooEnergy 供应商仪表板\",\n  \"dashboard.welcome.subtitle\": \"用于合规产品提交与销售的受监管工作平台\",\n\n  \"products.tabs.all\": \"产品目录\",\n  \"products.tabs.drafts\": \"新产品（草稿）\",\n  \"products.tabs.review\": \"审核中的产品\",\n  \"products.tabs.approved\": \"已批准产品\",\n  \"products.tabs.rejected\": \"已拒绝 / 已暂停产品\",\n\n  \"product.create.button\": \"创建新产品\",\n  \"product.category.select\": \"选择产品类别\",\n\n  \"product.images.title\": \"产品图片\",\n  \"product.images.requirement\": \"必须上传且仅能上传 6 张清晰的产品图片\",\n\n  \"approval.supplier.title\": \"供应商内部审批\",\n  \"approval.supplier.button\": \"批准产品提交\",\n\n  \"partner.select.title\": \"选择合规与认证服务合作伙伴\",\n  \"partner.review.status.pending\": \"合作伙伴审核中\",\n  \"partner.review.status.pass\": \"合作伙伴审核通过\",\n  \"partner.review.status.fail\": \"合作伙伴审核未通过\"\n}\n\n6. COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATION RULES\nA. Usage in Components\nCodex must ensure all supplier components follow this pattern:\n\nimport { useTranslations } from \"next-intl\";\n\nconst SupplierProductsPage = () => {\n  const t = useTranslations(\"supplier\");\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{t(\"dashboard.welcome.title\")}</h1>\n      <p>{t(\"dashboard.welcome.subtitle\")}</p>\n      <button>{t(\"product.create.button\")}</button>\n    </>\n  );\n};\nRules:\n* No raw strings\n* No inline Chinese or English\n* Everything goes through t(\"key\")\n\n7. FORMS, VALIDATION & ERROR MESSAGES\nCodex must ensure:\n* All field labels are translated\n* All placeholders are translated\n* All validation messages are translated\n* All blocking/error messages are translated\nExample:\n\n\"validation.images.count\": \"Exactly six product images are required\"\nChinese:\n\n\"validation.images.count\": \"必须上传且仅能上传 6 张产品图片\"\n\n8. LEGAL & GOVERNANCE TEXT HANDLING\nRules:\n1. English text remains the authoritative legal reference\n2. Chinese text is informational but complete\n3. Where required, add a small footnote:\nEnglish:\n“In case of inconsistency, the English version prevails.”\nChinese:\n“如中英文内容存在差异，以英文版本为准。”\nThis footnote must itself be translatable.\n\n9. DATA VS UI LANGUAGE (IMPORTANT)\nCodex must not translate stored data, only UI text.\n* Product names → supplier input (original language)\n* Certificates → original language\n* Uploaded documents → unchanged\n* Database values → language-neutral\nOnly labels, instructions, and system text are translated.\n\n10. PERSISTENCE OF LANGUAGE PREFERENCE\nCodex must implement:\n* preferredLanguage field on Supplier User profile\n* Values: en | zh-CN\n* On login:\n    * Load preference\n    * Initialise i18n context\n* On switch:\n    * Update preference immediately\n    * Persist via API\n\n11. TESTING REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)\nCodex must include tests to verify:\n* All supplier pages render correctly in both languages\n* No missing translation keys\n* No fallback to English when zh-CN is selected\n* Language switching does not reset Draft forms\n* Partner workflow, approvals, errors all display bilingual text\n\n12. GOVERNANCE RULE (FINAL)\nAny future supplier page, feature, or component:\n* Must include both English and Chinese text\n* Must not ship without translations\n* Must fail CI if untranslated keys are detected",
