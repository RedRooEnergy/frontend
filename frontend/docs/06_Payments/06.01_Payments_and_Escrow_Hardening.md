# Payments and Escrow Hardening
Version: v1.0 (LOCKED)  
Scope: Governance-only; no implementation

## Stripe / Wise Hardening Rules
- Enforce test/live key separation; no keys in repo.
- Webhook signatures must be verified and idempotent.
- Pricing snapshot hash required before payment initiation; mismatch triggers review.

## Refund Automation Constraints
- Refunds only when escrow not settled, unless admin override recorded.
- Webhook-confirmed state changes; no manual silent adjustments.

## Settlement Sequencing
- Settlement only after delivery proof and return-window expiry, unless admin override logged.
- Wise sandbox/live transfers must log transfer IDs and outcomes.

## Escrow Release Logic (Governance)
- Escrow status moves HELD → SETTLEMENT_ELIGIBLE → SETTLED.
- Release blocked if disputes/returns/warranties active.
- Overrides require approval ID and audit event.

## Governance Lock
- This document is locked. No changes permitted without formal change control approval.

Status: Locked.  
Implementation: Not authorised.
