# Consolidated Governance Maturity Index
Version: v1.0
Date: 2026-02-13
Basis: Blended scoring model approved by governance

## 1) Method
### 1.1 Scale (0-5)
- `0`: Not implemented
- `1`: Ad-hoc / informal
- `2`: Basic controls present
- `3`: Controlled and documented
- `4`: Deterministic + measurable
- `5`: Deterministic + measurable + externally auditable

A score of `5` is only awarded when all are present:
- deterministic artifacts
- exportable evidence
- testable controls
- signed/internal boundaries
- defined alerting/monitoring

### 1.2 Blended weighting
- Governance / Regulator: `40%`
- Technical Risk: `35%`
- Investor Confidence: `25%`

Formula:
`blended = (governance * 0.40) + (technical * 0.35) + (investor * 0.25)`

### 1.3 Heat map bands
- `4.5-5.0`: Governance-grade
- `3.5-4.49`: Production-mature
- `2.5-3.49`: Controlled but exposure present
- `<2.5`: High priority risk

  - `frontend/lib/auth/adminGuard.ts`
  - `frontend/app/api/auth/status/route.ts`
- Residual risk summary:
  - Role checks are present, but centralized policy enforcement and stronger privileged-session controls are not uniformly evident.
- Recommended next uplift:
  - Introduce centralized authorization policy layer with explicit action/resource checks, privileged-role MFA enforcement, and policy audit logs.

### 3.2 Payments (Stripe lifecycle)
- Evidence references:
  - Release anchor: `ext-payments-03-v1.0.0` (tag object SHA `01a8498adc7ed618618a763a2f4d97af9721cb30`)

  - `frontend/app/api/payments/stripe/webhook/route.ts`
  - `frontend/lib/payments/idempotencyStore.ts`
- Residual risk summary:
  - Primary residual risk is external provider outage/latency, not internal control design.
- Recommended next uplift:
  - Add external provider synthetic checks and automated failover playbooks.

### 3.3 Settlements (Wise lifecycle)
- Evidence references:
  - Release anchor: `ext-payments-03-v1.0.0` (tag object SHA `01a8498adc7ed618618a763a2f4d97af9721cb30`)

  - `frontend/docs/06_Payments/06.07_Payments_Production_Alerting_Matrix.md`
- Residual risk summary:
  - Escalation policy is well defined; practical maturity depends on real incident drills.
- Recommended next uplift:
  - Run quarterly game-day exercises and record measured TTA/TTM against matrix thresholds.

### 3.7 Freight Enforcement Controls
- Evidence references:
  - `frontend/lib/freightAudit/FreightSoftEnforcementService.ts`
  - `frontend/lib/freightAudit/FreightAuditShadowGating.ts`
  - `frontend/tests/freight-audit/FreightSoftEnforcementService.spec.ts`
  - `frontend/docs/04_Marketplace_Operations/04.13_Freight_Exception_Lifecycle_Architecture.md`
- Residual risk summary:
  - Strong architecture, but enforcement is intentionally pilot-scoped and not yet full-production across tenants.
- Recommended next uplift:
  - Complete staged expansion from pilot to controlled cohort rollout with measured false-positive tracking.

### 3.8 Compliance / Certification Controls
- Evidence references:
  - `frontend/lib/compliance/workflowStateMachine.ts`
  - `frontend/lib/compliance/store.ts`
  - `frontend/docs/05_Admin_Oversight/05.03_Compliance_Approval_Workflows.md`
- Residual risk summary:
  - Workflow and review controls exist, but deterministic replay-safe persistence, signed internal operational boundaries, and hard reconciliation parity are not yet at payments/freight maturity.
- Recommended next uplift:
  - Implement compliance v2 control plane: append-only ledger, deterministic manifest hashing, signed internal exports, and discrepancy reconciliation.

### 3.9 Authority Matrix & Delegation
- Evidence references:
  - `frontend/lib/auth/roleGuard.ts`
  - `frontend/lib/auth/adminGuard.ts`
  - `frontend/docs/05_Admin_Oversight/05.01_Admin_Oversight_and_Approvals.md`
- Residual risk summary:
  - Role-based checks are present; central delegated authority matrix and policy-verifiable approvals are not fully institutionalized across subsystems.
- Recommended next uplift:
  - Establish unified authority matrix service (delegation, approval scopes, expiry, revocation, audit export).

### 3.10 Audit & Evidence Chain
- Evidence references:
  - `frontend/lib/payments/providerEventStore.ts`
  - `frontend/lib/payments/reconciliation.ts`
  - `frontend/lib/compliance/store.ts`
  - `frontend/lib/freightAudit/FreightExceptionService.ts`
- Residual risk summary:
  - Evidence chain is strong in payments/freight; consistency across all subsystems remains uneven.
- Recommended next uplift:
  - Define platform-wide evidence contract (hashing, manifest schema, export signing, replay tooling).

### 3.11 Change Control Discipline
- Evidence references:
  - Phase-close and governance docs in `frontend/docs/06_Payments/06.06_EXT-PAYMENTS-03_Formal_Close_Pack.md`
  - Release tag `ext-payments-03-v1.0.0` (`01a8498adc7ed618618a763a2f4d97af9721cb30`)
- Residual risk summary:
  - Payments change discipline is strong; cross-subsystem discipline is not yet uniformly measured with a single scorecard.
- Recommended next uplift:
  - Introduce shared governance gate checklist across all subsystem releases.

### 3.12 Data Integrity & Hashing Model
- Evidence references:
  - `frontend/lib/payments/pricingSnapshot.ts`
  - `frontend/lib/payments/reconciliation.ts`
  - `frontend/lib/payments/metrics/engine.ts`
  - `frontend/lib/freightAudit/FreightAuditStore.ts`
- Residual risk summary:
  - Hash discipline is robust in hardened paths; not all domains share the same deterministic standards yet.
- Recommended next uplift:
  - Publish a platform-wide canonical hashing standard and enforce via shared library + tests.

### 3.13 Internal Signed Route Hardening
- Evidence references:
  - `frontend/app/api/internal/payments/reconcile/route.ts`
  - `frontend/app/api/internal/payments/metrics/snapshot/route.ts`
  - `frontend/app/api/internal/payments/wise/poll-transfer/route.ts`
- Residual risk summary:
  - Signed internal boundaries are implemented in payments operations; not yet generalized across all internal operational routes.
- Recommended next uplift:
  - Standardize signed-route middleware and apply consistently to all internal operational APIs.

### 3.14 Feature Flag Governance & Rollback Control
- Evidence references:
  - `frontend/lib/payments/config.ts`
  - `frontend/docs/06_Payments/06.06_EXT-PAYMENTS-03_Formal_Close_Pack.md`
  - `frontend/docs/99_Production/99.01_Production_Readiness_and_GoLive_Checklist.md`
- Residual risk summary:
  - Flag posture is strong in payments/freight pilots; enterprise-wide registry and ownership controls can be improved.
- Recommended next uplift:
  - Create centralized flag registry with owner, expiry, and mandatory removal/review SLAs.
