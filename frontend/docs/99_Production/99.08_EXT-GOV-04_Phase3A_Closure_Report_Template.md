- Tenant Cohort:
- Resource/Action Scope:
- Policy ID:
- Policy Version Hash:
- Window Start (UTC):
- Window End (UTC):
- Prepared By:
- Reviewed By:
- Approval Date (UTC):

## 2) Scope Confirmation
- Enforcement mode used during window:
  - `shadow-only warmup` / `non-strict enforcement` / `strict pilot`
- Cohort controls unchanged during window: `yes/no`
- Enforcement resolution order unchanged during window: `yes/no`
- Payments/freight unaffected by authority enforcement: `yes/no`

## 3) Telemetry Summary (14-Day)
- Total guard runs:
- Total digest files:
- WARN count:
- PAGE count:
- Rollback recommended count:
- Kill-switch activation count:
- First run timestamp:
- Last run timestamp:

## 4) Key Stability Metrics
- `deterministicMismatchTotal` max:
- `shadowVsEnforcementDivergenceTotal` max:
- `shadowVsEnforcementDivergenceRate` max:
- `POLICY_VERSION_UNRESOLVED_RATE` max:
- `CONFLICT_RATE` max:
- `CASE_OPEN_RATE` max:
- `PRODUCT_APPROVED` 403 anomaly observed: `yes/no`
- Route latency regression observed: `yes/no`

## 5) Enforcement Integrity Validation
- Dual-write hash proof violations observed: `yes/no`
- Divergence artifacts recorded (`shadowVsEnforcementDivergence=true`): count
- Enforcement artifact writes successful: `yes/no`
- Shadow artifact prerequisite preserved: `yes/no`
- Runtime kill-switch precedence validated: `yes/no`

## 6) Control Event Summary
- Control events total:
- `KILL_SWITCH_ACTIVATED` count:
- `KILL_SWITCH_DEACTIVATED` count:
- Latest control event timestamp:
- Latest kill-switch state:

## 7) Incident Record (if any)
For each incident:
- Incident ID:
- Trigger signal:
- Trigger timestamp:
- Guard report ID:
- Guard report hash:
- Control event ID:
- Operator:
- Corrective action:
- Recovery timestamp:

## 8) Evidence Pack References
- Guard index path (`index.jsonl`):
- Daily digest directory:
- Guard report IDs (range or list):
- Control event IDs (range or list):
- Divergence enforcement decision IDs (if any):
- Snapshot hashes archive location:

## 9) Go / No-Go Determination
- Determination: `GO` / `NO-GO`
- Basis:
  - `deterministicMismatchTotal == 0` for full window
  - `shadowVsEnforcementDivergenceRate == 0` (or documented variance)
  - `POLICY_VERSION_UNRESOLVED_RATE == 0`
  - No unresolved incident
  - No unexplained 403 surge
  - No payment/freight regression

## 10) Maturity Delta Update
- Authority maturity (pre-window):
- Authority maturity (post-window):
- Blended GOV-INDEX delta:
- Residual risk classification:

## 11) Next Stage Recommendation
- Recommended next stage:
  - `Hold in current cohort`
  - `Enable strict mode pilot`
  - `Prepare Phase 3B Compliance design`
- Required preconditions for next stage:
- Proposed start date:
