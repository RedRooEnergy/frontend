## Payment-Linked Disputes
- Disputes may pause settlement; refunds follow eligibility rules.
- Chargebacks (card) must map to audit trail and pricing snapshot.

## Hold / Refund Triggers
- Evidence of non-delivery, damaged goods, compliance failure, or fraud signals.
- If dispute raised pre-settlement, escrow remains held until resolution.

## Evidence Standards
- Shipment proofs, product condition evidence, correspondence logs.
- Timelines must be timestamped; all attachments linked to order.

## Authority and Resolution

- Final authority: Admin with recorded decision and rationale.
- Post-resolution actions: release, refund, or partial settlement (if governed and approved).

## Governance Lock
- This document is locked. No changes permitted without formal change control approval.
