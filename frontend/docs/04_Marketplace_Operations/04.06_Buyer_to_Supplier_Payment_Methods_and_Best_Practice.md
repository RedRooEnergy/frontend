# Buyer → Supplier Payment Methods and Best Practice (AU → CN)
Version: v1.0 (LOCKED)  
Scope: Governance-only; no implementation

## Payment Policy (AU → CN)
- Default settlement path: buyer pays RedRooEnergy; funds held in escrow; supplier paid post-eligibility.
- Cross-border corridor: AUD → CNY via approved rails; FX quoted upfront; no on-the-fly FX outside approved rails.
- Transaction size bands:
  - ≤ AUD 5,000: card (Stripe test/production) permitted; full prepayment only.
  - AUD 5,001–50,000: card or bank rails (SWIFT/Airwallex/Wise); full prepayment preferred; staged only if pre-approved.
  - > AUD 50,000: bank rails only (SWIFT/Airwallex/Wise); full prepayment unless explicit governance waiver.
- Full prepayment rules:
  - Default for new buyers, new suppliers, or unproven logistics lanes.
  - Required when compliance evidence is incomplete or shipment insurance is absent.
- Partial/staged payments:
  - Allowed only with documented waiver and milestone evidence plan.
  - Milestones must align to fulfilment proofs (e.g., pickup, export clearance, POD).

## Approved Methods
- Stripe (card) — small/medium orders; SCA-ready; subject to card limits.
- SWIFT — high-value, bank-to-bank.
- Airwallex — multi-currency collections and payouts; sandbox/live under governance.
- Wise — sandbox/live payouts to suppliers; AUD source only.

## Explicit Exclusions
- No cash, cheques, crypto, informal value transfer, or unverified PSPs.
- No uncontrolled FX desks; no payer/supplier-directed off-platform payments.

## Audit & Documentation
- Every payment path must log: method, amount, currency, FX rate (if any), payer, beneficiary, timestamps, approvals.
- Pricing snapshot hash must be recorded before payment initiation.
- Webhook events must be idempotent and stored for reconciliation.
- Waivers (staged payments, alternative rails) require recorded approval ID and approver role.

## Governance Lock
- This document is locked. No changes permitted without formal change control approval.

Status: Locked.  
Implementation: Not authorised.
