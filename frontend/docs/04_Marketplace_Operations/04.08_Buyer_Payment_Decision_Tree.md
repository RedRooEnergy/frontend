# Buyer Payment Decision Tree
Version: v1.0 (LOCKED)  
Scope: Governance-only; no implementation

## Decision Logic (Text-Only)
- IF order value ≤ AUD 5,000 THEN
  - Require full prepayment.
  - Allowed methods: Stripe card; Wise/Airwallex optional.
- IF order value between AUD 5,001–50,000 THEN
  - Require full prepayment unless admin waiver.
  - Allowed methods: Stripe card, Wise, Airwallex, SWIFT.
  - IF buyer is new OR supplier is new THEN no waiver; full prepayment.
- IF order value > AUD 50,000 THEN
  - Require bank rails (Wise/Airwallex/SWIFT).
  - Full prepayment by default; staging only with risk approval and milestone plan.

## Buyer Risk Acceptance Points
- Waiver requests must include: reason, evidence of supplier reliability, logistics plan, insurance status.
- Admin must record waiver ID; audit trail must link to order.

## Required Documents per Branch
- All branches: pricing snapshot hash, invoice/proforma, compliance declarations.
- Staged branch: milestone plan, shipment insurance proof, export/import licences (if applicable).

## Approved Payment Path Per Outcome
- Full prepayment path: payment → escrow hold → fulfilment → return window → settlement.
- Staged path (approved only): payment tranche → escrow hold → milestone evidence → next tranche; final settlement on completion.

## Governance Lock
- This document is locked. No changes permitted without formal change control approval.

Status: Locked.  
Implementation: Not authorised.
