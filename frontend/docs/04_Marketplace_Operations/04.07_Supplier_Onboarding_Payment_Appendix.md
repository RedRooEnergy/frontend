## KYB and Export Readiness
- KYB: legal name, registration, directors/UBOs, address, sanctions/PEP screening.
- Export readiness: HS codes, dual-use declarations, export licences (if applicable), MSDS where required.

## Refusal of Staged Payments
- Supplier may refuse staging if:
  - Goods are bespoke or non-resellable.
  - Compliance documents are buyer-dependent and missing.
  - Logistics lane risk is high without insurance.
- Refusal must be documented with rationale and approved by platform admin.
